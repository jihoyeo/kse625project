       "  'I left Table 17 feeling very ambivalent. Meh as others would put it. Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between.\\n\\nThe room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d\\'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn\\'t do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!\\n\\nMy server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town. for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three.  okay. lets break it down.\\n\\nthe service.  when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive.  we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available.  there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair.  not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal.   i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three.  if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine.  the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience.  every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself.  its not the problem of the customer.  its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself.\\n\\nfor lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup.  we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip.  not exorbitant and not cheap.  though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home.  in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not.  but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti.  its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is.\\n\\nthat being said the sandwiches tasted great.  (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\").\\n\\nthe vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.\\n\\ni enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.\\n\\nall my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable. Love this place. I went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I am glad my colleagues suggested me this place. The food is really really good. They have a great cocktail list. \\n\\nWe shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it). Then, I had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I\\'ve tried. I am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!! \\n\\nThe service was slow so don\\'t go there if you are in a rush! Our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French. \\n\\nI will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live! Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17.  Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just).  \\n\\nLovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent.  Also, the food prices\\n\\nAll in all a great evening  - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish.   \\n\\nDefinitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu. Table 17 is a classic bistro with a very good menu, wine list and cocktail list.\\n\\nI\\'ve been many times for dinner as well as brunch.\\n\\nFood is always consistent, have never not liked anything I have ordered. \\n\\nDinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.\\n\\nBrunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer\\'s breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn\\'t look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.\\n\\nNote: If you are a member of Foursquare, check out their specials for check-ins, last time i was there for brunch you got a mimosa or caesar on the house with you check-ins. I\\'ve been here for a few dinners and brunches, and it has been a pleasure every time. \\n\\nThe service has always been very attentive and helpful. For one of the dinners, our group had trouble deciding on dishes so our server suggested that we pick a price point and let the chef put together a menu. It was a really fantastic experience! Ok, full disclosure:  went here as a default because Ascari Enoteca was closed down due to a busted water pipe or something.  \\nFood was AMAZING!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 3 mains, as well as dessert and cocktails......thought for sure we would get something that we did not like, but alas everything was delicious.  To quote an obnoxiously catchy song from The Lego Movie, \"Everything is awesome....\" We had an exceptional experience at Table 17. Chef John prepared an incredible fois gras app, the squid ceviche did not disappoint... the Rainbow trout was melt in your mouth delicious and we ended our foodgasm with the dark chocolate tort. Found this place by chance and walked in for brunch on a Sunday. There was one table available luckily. There wasn\\'t a lot on the menu, but all the items we ordered wew so fabulous!! And very out of the ordinary. Service was good too.\\n\\nFrench toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous. It\\'s a delight for the senses, this place. By far my favourite restaurant in the east end. Always great food and service - and a cool and inspired cocktail list. Great for any occasion! I booked the private room for a small wedding reception recently. We had 14 guests, the room was perfect. Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate.\\n\\n\\nThe dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we\\'re too busy eating.\\n\\nWe had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent.\\n\\nIt was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day. I don\\'t think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal.\\n\\nMy favourite was the polenta bolognese. I could eat that for days. I wasn\\'t super impressed but I also wasn\\'t really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment. \\n\\nThe restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.\\n\\nI found myself here ordering the much touted \"Hot Balls\" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the \"Diver Scallops\" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the \"Leg of Lamb\" and \"Wild Stripped Bass\" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn\\'t have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn\\'t amount to much for my taste buds. \\n\\nThe Wine list is very French and if you\\'re going by the bottle they don\\'t really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. \\n\\nOverall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don\\'t place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they\\'re suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.\\n\\nI hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night. I had a nice time at Table 17.\\n\\nIt was busy when we got there. We had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he\\'s in his early 100s) was a riot.\\n\\nI had the polenta to start. It was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh-so-good.\\n\\nI had the short ribs as my main. The meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked.\\n\\nWe shared the hunters mash as a side - I was expecting more flavour.\\n\\nTable 17 had a great vibe to it.\\nThe food was good. The servers were attentive. I\\'d definitely go back. We had the scotch egg and the tomato based eggs. Everything was delish!\\nWhile I prefer to have my bread toasted I understand it\\'s not the french way (and they would have accommodated if I asked!)\\n\\nThe potato rosti was totally worth breaking the diet for, and comes in 4 pieces and is easily shared!\\n\\nThe americano was outstanding they use amazing beans, and I wanted more. I had on of their $5 mimosas which is something that would keep me coming back weekly if I could !\\n\\nThe staff are all super lovely, and the ingredients were all do fresh (you can tell these things)\\nA perfect brunch spot, no need to wait in line at the other two \"brunch hot spots\" in the area. \\n\\nHighly recommend this spot! my first time here. Very impressed. Food was very tasty. Our waiter recommended me the Trout and it was amazing. So fresh. It came with a side of vegetables and i got some steak fries with it as well.  The service was pretty spot on and we were always asked if  everything was o.k...which it was. Walked in on a cold saturday afternoon round 1330!\\nwaitress Helen received us very warmly and sat us at the best table for two by the window in the sun with view onto queen st east.\\nWe started with mimosas while studying the brunch menu.\\nHelen was helpful, knowledgeable  and prompt.\\nI ordered the seasonal scramble, which today was chorizo artisanal, and tarragon scrambled fluffyly together with country butter toast. Loved it.\\nMy girlfriend had the french toast, cinnamon creme anglaise and berries which she thought was pretty good.\\nWe then asked for a cheese plate which was only available for dinner.\\nHelen accommodated us with it anyway:\\n*Paillot de chevre\\n*Mapledale 5 year cheddar\\n*Ciel de charlevoix\\n*Monforte toscano pecorino\\n*Clandestin \\nGreat little figs stuffed with walnuts dry crannies and almonds\\nA good bottle of sancerre and \"Voila\"\\n$118 for the both of us\\nwill come back, loved it! I was very excited to try Table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down. I was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that I walked in. It was terrible service, and I was very surprised to see this. The waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. We waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came.  The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. Wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. We did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. We had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. An all around let down for a place that I had heard was good. Had an enjoyable meal at this Leslieville spot. Menu is light on  vegetarian options but is otherwise diverse. The tagliatelle was al dente and did not disappoint. My pal ate the steak and frites and licked the plate clean. My pomegranate cocktail was so sweet and satisfying\\n that I had two. I\\'ve had the pleasure of dining at Table 17 on two occasions. One time we were a group of four and another time it was just me and my husband. The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics. It just feels good when you walk in. The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent. Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps! (re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto). If you\\'re feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn\\'t?) I\\'d suggest the Bourbon sour. Yummy. I\\'m going to ignore the fact that the service was off and just chock that up to the fact that it was the poor girl\\'s first week, so the cocktail spilled, the flatware dropped and the general feeling that the girl was nervous as all get out didn\\'t really taint my evening because the food was excellent. \\n\\nOur group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17. As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn\\'t have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don\\'t think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you\\'ll want to start forking at your neighbor\\'s! I was impressed this place had such a strong cocktail program, figured wine was where it\\'s at, at a place like this. I love this place.  It\\'s definitely a little pricey, so it\\'s more of a special occasion place.  Love the décor.\\n\\nThey have a gigantic table in the center of the restaurant where they slice your bread.  Kinda cool, but it takes up a lot of useful real estate.  Another 2 or 3 tables could potentially be in it\\'s place.\\n\\nThe \"hot balls\" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them.  I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever had anything like them before.  There are 3 different types:  Arancino - mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - wildflower honey, and Arancino - spiced lamb stuffed risotto.  A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious.\\n\\nI went with the fish (trout) for my entrée.  It was very good.  Nothing special or unique to report.\\n\\nI was very impressed with the service here.  I\\'ve recommended this restaurant to others, and they\\'ve loved it too. Considering the amount of rave reviews on here, I suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at Table 17. Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression. So did my guests.\\n\\nThe dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn\\'t like it was packed. Still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. \\n\\nOur server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. Scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. It was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. \\n\\nOur table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so I ordered another glass of wine so I could enjoy some with dinner. That glass arrived 20 mins after I was finished my main. Lots of apologies but little else.\\n\\nThat being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. And the space is gorgeous. However, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren\\'t great. The Halibut was the best of the bunch.\\n\\nConsidering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, I won\\'t visit again. Booked through OpenTable a few days before, for 8pm. Zipped right in to our table.\\nHad the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow! The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big béarnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon).\\n\\nHad the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates.\\nMy friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert.\\n\\nThe cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car!\\nMy friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert.\\n\\nAll in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date\\'s was ho-hum. We agreed though that we\\'d give it another chance based on the scallops alone.\\n\\nThe service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable. Too bad others had issues, thought our guy was fine.\\n\\nReservations are definitely recommended, was quite busy. I came here for weekend brunch. We arrived around 11:30 and there was no wait, lots of free tables. It was packed by 12 or 12:30 though. \\n\\nThe place is cozy and inviting. It\\'s nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d\\'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids. The chicken theme (in the logo, decor) reminded me of the old Bistro Bakery Thuet. \\n\\nThe brunch menu changes seasonally, so the current offerings are different from the menu on the website. I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer\\'s Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It\\'s chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently. \\n\\nThe whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food. Service was friendly and attentive. \\n\\nStreet parking on weekends is usually easy to find and $1.50 per hour. \\n\\nI checked-in and unlocked and offer for $36 for a \"14 oz. (!!) Heritage Beef Ribeye with hen of the woods mushrooms and mint & orange gremolata\" for my next visit. I\\'ll be frank: the only way we could afford this place was due to a gift certificate from a generous wedding guest. However, the food was right on the money. Good flavor; prompt service. If you have the money, go! We were here for brunch a few weeks back - delish !  Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn\\'t have to wait all that long for a table.  And a good brunch can\\'t just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome.  We don\\'t really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we\\'ll be back. I came here with my sisters for brunch on a Sunday so there was free street parking. (Yay!). \\n\\nThe decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out. We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades. \\n\\nService was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers. \\n\\nThe brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal. \\n\\nI had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing.  The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can\\'t go wrong. The fried polenta didn\\'t seem \"fried\" as it wasn\\'t crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that\\'s probably why it\\'s called the \"Sloppy\" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn\\'t enough). \\nMy sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup. Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn\\'t busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don\\'t think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it\\'s the food that counts!\\nWe had...\\nHot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.\\nPolenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.\\nSteak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!\\n\\nWill I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid. One of my favourite restaurants in the neighbourhood. Food is consistent and the service impeccable. \\n\\nThe steak frites are the best in the city. Scallops, duck confit and short ribs are also regular favourites. Literally my FAVORITE new restaurant in the northern hemisphere. I\\'ve all but given up on Toronto until finding this gem through a friend in New York who raved about it. \\nTook my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience. \\nEverything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular. \\nThe highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavors\\nKudos.\\nWe\\'ll be back soon! The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed. \\n\\nFirstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can\\'t help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I\\'ve asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( \\n\\nThe only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. \\n\\nOverall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing! \\n\\n-CL \\n\\nPS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :) On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well.\\n\\nThough the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine.\\n\\nRight off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you\\'re lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. \\n\\nStill, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.\\n\\nAnd once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his \"little neglected table.\" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.\\n\\nFood-wise though, things were great. We weren\\'t terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d\\'hote fixed price menu going with the \"shared food\" section on the left column of the menu. It\\'s a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. \\n\\nRich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a \"sugo\" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.\\n\\nAlongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained \"sauce & balls\" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were \"al dente\" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.\\n\\nWines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion\\'s \"Anna 6\" white was very dry and very refreshing. \\n\\nIn addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was \"out\" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.\\n\\nTotal cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.\\nThis would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d\\'hote option + drinks.\\n\\nI would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can\\'t give it more than three stars out of five. Food: 9.5/10\\nAtmosphere: 8/10 \\nService: 9.5/10\\nOverall experience: 9/10\\n\\nA lovely experience overall. Went and ordered:\\n- foie gras appetizer\\n- polenta (main #1)\\n- pasta special\\n\\nAll the food was great. You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.\\n\\nThe service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn\\'t feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service. We went on a Travelzoo coupon and we arrived early for our 7:30 reservation. No problem, here\\'s your table. Our server was fantastic! I can\\'t remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients.\\nWe had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both!\\n My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days\\' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it.  It was probably the best venison I\\'ve ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic. \\nThe wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding.\\n All in all an excellent dining experience. This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entré. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can\\'t complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They\\'re moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you\\'re in the area. Something different for date night. We were back here this evening.  Delish!\\n\\nI ordered the beef tartare - it was pretty tasty, large enough to share as beef tartare is both an acquired taste and fairly rich on it\\'s own.  My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour.  \\n\\nMy bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish.  I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!  It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine.  \\n\\nWe went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I\\'m happy to report, that next time, I\\'ll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion! Love this restaurant!!! Awesome brunch, $10 for anything on the menu. My hubby doesn\\'t get super full off of the stuff, but I\\'m good with the amount. Awesome decor too!! We went here for Mother\\'s Day brunch.  I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast. Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices.  We got our son a fresh berry yogurt which I ended up eating most of it because it was so good. My son was still quite happy regardless. We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back. The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon. We had a great time. Dinner for 4 - with a healthy amount of food (or unhealthy - depends on how you look at it).\\n\\nThe polenta had their \"reindeer sauce\" which consisted of venison, spices, and berries. Delicious. \\n\\nOysters were tasty, and the braised pork was unbelievably good. No idea what they used for aromatics - but there was a hint of fennel that was incredible. \\n\\n$400 for 4 people and drinks. Not a value dinner, but enjoyable, and guarantees my return. \\n\\nOh. Peanut Butter Panna Cotta. Order it and thank me later. Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating. I just can\\'t see anything wrong with this place. I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d\\'hôte we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!) We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous.\\n\\nAs a big bonus the place is BYOB with no corkage fees for one or two bottles.\\n\\nA couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this. The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful. Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening? In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more. I wish I could share Avitania B.\\'s Groupon enthusiasm because I found this place a big let down. I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try. \\n\\nAt first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast! Picture It\\'s 9pm and you are trying to enjoy your meal next to four tables of three super loud middle-aged women who are all gossipping and complaining about their \"first-world problems\": She only got a 1.5 karat ring... I hate it when my maid doesn\\'t iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah. I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up. This is by no means the restaurant\\'s fault but killed the ambiance for sure.\\n\\nThe food itself was good but the portions are quite small. I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18.\\n\\nI found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive. At times I felt as though I might need a bell to get the waiter\\'s attention. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love that they aren\\'t over-priced (not cheap either, mind you) and that they can usually manage to squeeze you in at the end of the service without a reservation (I\\'m a late eater.) The appetizers are where it is at here! Had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great. I had the Sloppy Giuseppe - Two sunny side eggs top a crispy, fried polenta cake, surrounded by a moat of Bolognese sauce. Awesome. I\\'ll definitely be back for that alone. Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes.\\n\\nIs that enough for me to give it five stars? No.\\n\\nI\\'ve been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.\\n\\nWhy? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.\\n\\nThe dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as \"Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue\"?! \\n\\nAgain I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. \\n\\nThankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can\\'t see why I wouldn\\'t return to Table 17, for a special occasion. \\n\\nThis restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself. Brunchy time and we have a winner.  To start, we got a seat right away on Sunday for brunch.  I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.\\n\\nFor my meal, I had the french toast.  It was good - light and perfectly cooked.  The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  There was an assortment of berries as well.  Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. \\n\\nDefinitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire! What an experience: from the shabby-chic decor, to the wonderful service, Table 17 was an all-around treat. \\n\\nFirst off the \"hot balls\" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab. Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing.\\n\\nFor dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can\\'t really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty. The presentation of the halibut wrapped in ramps (mild leek), was a show-stopper (as was the pomegranate mojito). \\n\\nGreat place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience. Was here for my first time just last week. Loved it. It was highlighted by the Soft Shell Crab and the Hunter\\'s Mash. Also tried my first pint of Chambly on a recommendation from the bartender. I will be hunting this beer down in other restaurants I visit. \\nAlso, they are very quick to respond to any questions you have via Twitter. Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.\\n\\nWent to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn\\'t think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn\\'t the comfiest, but that was our fault.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn\\'t necessary because our appetizer came quickly.\\n\\nTo start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn\\'t too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. \\n\\nFor my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can\\'t quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I\\'m sure I\\'m forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.\\n\\nMy date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn\\'t get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. \\n\\nWe contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I\\'d skip the appetizer and try a dessert.\\n\\nOnly main downfall was sitting at the bar, it\\'s not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it\\'s near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.\\n\\nNot sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.\\n\\nOverall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend. If you want to have a more quiet place to meet up with your spouses parents for the first time - that\\'s the place to go on a Saturday morning. Make sure to come early as they don\\'t accept reservations for less than groups of 6!! We really enjoyed this place.  Food and service was excellent.  Table 17 has different and unique things to try! I highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!! I went here for the brunch the other day in this little bistro-style restaurant in Leslieville and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings. I couldn\\'t get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. \\n\\nAnd obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. \\n\\nMaybe it\\'s because it\\'s new, but the service was the one thing that didn\\'t make this a 5 star occasion. Our waitress was slow, took forever to take our order and then forgot what we wanted. But the food was so good that it didn\\'t ruin the experience. Great decor, great food, great drinks.\\nFood was really good, not a huge selection on the menu, but it was also a set menu for the night, so can\\'t comment on the normal menu. Food was very tasty, and there was a very different selection of draft beer, all ones I hadn\\'t heard of, but the one I tried was very good. Will definitly be going back! \"Table 17 is the rare restaurant that\\'s both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,\" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That\\'s a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t a fan of Table 17 back then and I\\'m not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.\\n\\nThe kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn\\'t say they\\'re under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.\\n\\nA meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.\\n\\nI\\'ve always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant\\'s bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can\\'t be bothered to offer it.\\n\\n\\nOysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.\\n\\nWe opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.\\n\\nFor our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where\\'s the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).\\n\\nThe Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit \"salad\" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.\\n\\nOur dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.\\n\\nSide dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It\\'s nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.\\n\\nAs with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you\\'d get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.\\n\\nThe message at the end of the day is - don\\'t let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.\\n\\nOur meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17. Stopped in right after lunch shift for a couple drinks. Bar tender was really helpful, friendly, and made for a great weekend afternoon drink. That said, they were definitely on the pricey end. Great service, the food and drinks were a miss.\\n\\nLimited menu so we went with the waiter\\'s recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.\\n\\nPOLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.\\n\\nMains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. \\n\\nThe recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.\\n\\nOverall, I\\'d have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine. I went here with a group of 4 late on a friday night at around 9:30 pm. We had a bottle of wine, foie gras, risotto, the ribeye, and a few other sides. Everything was perfect. Service was great. Prices were not cheap, but worth every bit. This is a place is good for 2 to 4 people who don\\'t mind sharing some delicious plates and paying for quality. PEI oysters with the lime-tequila sauce were great.  The menu on the website was out of date, so the bearnaise I was expecting to have with my steak frites was not available. However, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good. Had a travelzoo voucher for this place. Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks \"might as well get your money\\'s worth, right?\". I was a little offended at the comment, I\\'m not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my \"age\" and our voucher. \\n\\nAfter that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. \\n\\nThe restaurant crowd wasn\\'t my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. \\n\\nI honestly felt like we were given the \"pretty woman\" young+poor treatment. Guess you can\\'t tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $. \\n\\nBc we had the voucher I didn\\'t mind as much that we weren\\'t taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!\\n\\nAll in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t chance going back and getting similar service while paying full price. It wouldn\\'t be worth it. Rarely do I ever venture east of Yonge. It terrifies me. But when my BFF requested we go to Table 17 for her birthday, I put on my big girl pants and made my way to the East. Walking along queen, east of Broadview, I was amazed at how much has changed (I lived on Broadview and Dundas years ago and this was NOT the place to be). \\n\\nOnce we arrived at Table 17 I was really impressed with the overall vibe. Warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (I love seeing who\\'s making my meal!). \\n\\nI had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. It was chalked full of flavour. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (Some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served). \\n\\nThe server was wonderful. He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn\\'t needed. \\n\\nGreat venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks. Had brunch again at Table 17 for a third time and each time it\\'s been better and better.  Last time I had the daily quiche and it was good.  Today I have the Alsatian tart with salad and I enjoyed every bite of it.  \\n\\nI\\'m really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service.  Having been to this restaurant six or so times now, I have never once encountered any rudeness.  Maybe I\\'ve just lucked out. I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville\\'s best kept secret! I went for brunch with my husband and a friend. For Saturday brunch at prime brunching hour, we were quickly seated. The place wasn\\'t full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door. It made a great easy Saturday morning. \\n\\nServing staff were friendly and helpful. We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don! My tart was so flaky and warm. Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch. Everyone\\'s plates were well-presented. \\n\\nThe decor had rustic charm and we didn\\'t feel crammed in like many small brunch spots. \\n\\nOur coffees and water were constantly refilled and I spent an easy afternoon sitting and catching up with friends. What more can you ask for to make an enjoyable and easy-going Saturday brunch? \\n\\nI would definitely return to Table 17. The only downside about this place is that somehow I\\'ve only just discovered it!\\n\\nMy friend and I walked in around 11:00am on a Saturday after a workout. The restaurant was reasonably busy but there was no line-up - a welcome change for weekend brunch in Leslieville/Riverdale! The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy. Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event.\\n\\nMy friend had a dish (whose name escapes me) but consisted of eggs served on bolognese sauce on top of polenta. I had the quiche with a tomato salad. Both were really fantastic. Brunch entrees were reasonably priced at about $10.\\n\\nDuring our meal we saw a server walk by wih an order of frites and quickly decided we had to order them. No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious! At $4, totally worth it.\\n\\nI would absolutely return and recommend. Dropped in on a Sunday for Table 17\\'s BYOW Table D\\'Hote.  There was a \\'96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging.  \\nTable D\\'hote gives you a  selection of pork belly, steak frites, trout and a vegetarian option with a selection of first courses and desserts to go with it.  \\nNeither of our dishes disappointed.  \\nWhat we got was high quality, well prepared bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Service was efficient if not overly friendly. \\n\\nI remain a fan of this cosy Queen East bistro and wouldn\\'t think twice about many repeat visits. The fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for $35 were to die for. Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless.  I am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in Toronto. Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service.\\n\\nThe much-touted hot balls appetizers are a little over-rated: they are basically breaded, deep-fried balls of something with dipping sauce and were edible but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nFor entrees we had the delicious beef short ribs and black cod.  Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour).\\n\\n$250 for 4 people with some booze. Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window. I\\'m sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours. \\n\\nThe service started off being attentive and slowly started to slip (e.g. My date had to go find a waiter to get me a side plate for me to put shells from my seafood linguine, despite me having asked for it 5 min earlier). The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh! \\n\\nI enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17\\'s olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant\\'s. My seafood linguine was average. I believe my date had lamb and he said it was fine. We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate. Overall, we weren\\'t blow out of the water and have made no plans to go back as we were expecting more. Make sure you make a reservation! The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it\\'s too expensive for it\\'s location and quality.  It\\'s still pretty good, I just don\\'t like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.  \\n\\nThe good:\\n- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality\\n- Sundays and Mondays it\\'s bring your own wine with no corkage fees\\n- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu\\n- They do potato rosti right\\n- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon\\n- Good service both times I\\'ve been\\n- Proximity to my house\\n- they use opentable\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don\\'t come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I\\'m not classy enough to eat bacon here.\\n- It\\'s not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don\\'t mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won\\'t spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I\\'ve been here Sarah T picked.)\\n\\nNo funny stories.\\n\\nWould I go here again?  Maybe.  I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights.  Man, this place is just too expensive.  I know that\\'s all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here. This was a nice little surprise.  My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited.  The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we\\'d give it a whirl.  \\n\\nThere was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy.  There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.  The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be.\\n\\nI will return. I can\\'t seem to make the half star symbol work because I\\'d give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. \\n\\nI can\\'t say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef\\'s tables as well. \\n\\nSpecials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). \\n\\nWe started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I\\'m such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. \\n\\nI opted for (let\\'s be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don\\'t realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn\\'t sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. \\n\\nWe passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can\\'t quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession! Table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit. My girlfriend and I stumbled across it for brunch one weekend and were impressed. We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise.\\n\\nThe people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and \\'rustic chic\\' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve. \\n\\nSpeaking of food, it\\'s the best part. I don\\'t have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. Servings were generous so you won\\'t come away hungry. \\n\\nBravo guys. Bra-vo. We\\'re regulars here. Delicious brunchs! Delicious dinners! Service is quick and helpful. Is a dressed-up/relaxed place. Bonjour Brioche have a line, come here!!! I had very high expectations of Table 17 as it was recommended to us by a bartender at Origin (where I had a phenomenal experience - see my review) and a good family friend (who has exquisite taste). What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. \\n\\nAnd so it goes...\\n\\n I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. \\n\\nThe service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day\\'s specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. \\n\\nThe food? It was good, but forgetable (don\\'t hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. \\n\\nLike the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it\\'s a must order. Even if you don\\'t like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that\\'s just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). \\n\\nWe also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it\\'s on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. \\n\\nI know every restaurant can\\'t be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot. Appetizer:\\nHot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mint\\nMy friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn\\'t punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. \\n\\nDiver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale\\nI liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. \\n\\nEntrée:\\n\\nHaddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish\\nPerhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn\\'t enough. \\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nLemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! \\n\\nIn the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here. Table 17 had garnered a lot of loyal patrons over the years. I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant! I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review.\\n\\nAmong the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17\\'s lead on this generous offering.\\n\\nI am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!) \\n\\nThat said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I\\'m feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco. Taste good but bad value. Portions are way too small. We both had a app main and desert and still very hungry. Very good food and great atmosphere, friendly service. Bottom line: impossible to go wrong with a visit. Went to a Brunch party and it was so cool and awesome, the food and service where amazing and the stuff where so funny!! \\n\\nKnow I here is shut down and closed that\\'s sad :( What a relaxed place to enjoy a nice dinner. Table 17 is intimate, split into two rooms.  The service is very personal but not invasive.  Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed. \\n\\nThe menu is well edited with interesting selections. We choose the artichokes and  bocconcini as the starters followed by venison and steak tartare, with sides of amazing Brussels sprouts and frites. All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout. \\n\\nI have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best. Certainly will return. I think the main problem with this place is that it is too small to accommodate people who may want to hang out after dinner and have a few drinks. There is a bar, but it\\'s small. \\n\\nAs for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here. \\n\\nThe food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don\\'t enjoy spice, but there is a balance.\\n\\nThe duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I\\'m not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that\\'s how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage. \\n\\nThe duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile.  The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared. \\n\\nThe arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me. \\n\\nWe might even go back before we leave Toronto  to try the Polenta, which unfortuntely they were out of. Disappointing experience.  The restaurant was packed and my friend and I were crammed into a small table where we were basically touching elbows with the tables beside us.  The food wasn\\'t anything special which surprised me - I had been intrigued to try this place for a while but I won\\'t be going back. Went for Sunday brunch. Nacoise salad for me, scramble of the day for my friend.  Waiter had an attitude. Food was good / acceptable. Decor was lovely (especially the bathroom!), however  I wouldn\\'t go back again. Table 17 is a quaint find in Leslieville village perfect for a good catch up with your girlfriends or a dinner date.  The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic.  The menu has amazing sharing plates and we do choose a couple to start with. \\nWe were very impressed with the presentation of the polenta du jour dish.  This is a must at Table 17!  The fluffy, white polenta, dished out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by the chef who ladled a \"ragu\" of steaming lamb on top of it. There was chili and dried basil on little spoons for more flavour.  It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3.  The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air.\\nAs a note, Sundays and Mondays it\\'s bring your own wine with no corkage fees with decent prix fix menu on offer Meh. Service was bad and food wasn\\'t much better. The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.\\n\\nTo be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancé ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices. \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed. I had a groupon certificate for Table 17 and I\\'m not usually one to purchase groupons unless it\\'s a place I really want to try or already like, We walked in without reservations, which I am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I\\'m in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.\\n\\nThe hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.\\n\\nDesserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.\\n\\nOverall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!\\n\\nP.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it\\'s in very bad taste to not acknowledge this. Had dinner with some colleagues on Monday Dec 30, 13.  The food was ah-ma-zing!!  In addition it was BYOW night and no corkage fee - just some extra special icing on an already delicious cake!  You can\\'t go wrong at table17. I\\'m confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back. \\n\\nThe food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!\\n\\nMy bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore. Came for brunch with my wife and two young boys on a Saturday. We had the scotch eggs and Giuseppe eggs. They have $4 kids meals too. We got the French toast which was two slices with fruits. We also got a side of rosti. Everything was really delicious and unique. I\\'ve been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top. Full of flavour but not too heavy. Prices were all pretty reasonable around $10-$12. We\\'ll be coming back for sure! What a great little restaurant in Leslieville.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service.  Not too expensive and the the variety on the menu was a nice change from many other restaurants in the city. \\n\\nCall me a fan. I will definitely go back! For a small place, Table 17 is very accommodating.  I was a part of a very large party (10+ people) who could not make up their mind.  Various members called the restaurant multiple times to change our reservation.  I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren\\'t horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand.... Let\\'s just say I\\'m very happy I wasn\\'t paying ($15 for a basic martini). I have only been for brunch but was impressed.  Very friendly staff.  Somewhat traditional French brunch menu, and well executed items.  They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great.  The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I\\'m and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it. All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place. After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.\\n\\nService was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn\\'t seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I\\'m definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D\\'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I\\'m totally bringing cash. We\\'ve been here for brunch a couple of times. Had the rosti both times, as well as the neapolitan eggs and the weekly scramble. Both times everything has been excellent and the service is great and friendly. Also entirely reasonably priced. Recommended. I\\'ve been to Table 17 twice, and since the first time I came here, I have been anticipating the next time I would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding!\\nWith a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner.\\n\\nThe tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)\\n\\nFor our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.\\n\\nIt happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.\\n\\nOn a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I\\'m just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband\\'s review), and very tasty.\\n\\nFor dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I\\'m not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.\\n\\nI\\'m so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn\\'t repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint. I can never resist hot ballZ (sexy menu item here at Table 17).\\n\\nConveniently located near Jilly\\'s (hey!!!), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it\\'s such a nice place.\\n\\nI tried the Ontario lamb with merguez sausage (lamb x 2!) for my entree. Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious. A perfect plate.\\n\\nThe hot balls come 3 ways and each is served with it\\'s own dipping sauce. I think these are a \"must have\" if you come here.\\n\\nThe service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off .\\n\\nIt\\'s a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed. Definitely a great date spot.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive but the price point was a bit over the top - no bottles under $60 and the 1/2 liters started at $45. Apparently on Sunday/Monday you can bring-your-own-wine, but not sure what the corkage fee was. I have been hear a couple of times and overall have enjoyed the food.  I had the trout as my main and it was very fresh and perfectly cooked.  It came with some pretty boring side vegetables but overall the meal was satisfying.  Its a little on the pricey side but our server was great and I enjoy the vibe. Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I\\'m not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.\\n\\nMy pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. \\n\\nSlinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.\\n\\nPortions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.\\n\\nService is excellent.\\n\\nTable 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work. Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit. \\n\\nSpecial was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I\\'m not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum. \\n\\nNice wine list. Will return soon. \\n\\nOnly thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times. The things that I liked:\\n\\nInterior was homely, lots of wood used on the walls & furniture, there was a chandelier & the bar had accommodation to dine at if you chose to.\\n\\nServer was a very lively & attentive British man.\\n\\nSome qualms I had with the place was that my drink was a bit warm & my food not warm enough.\\n\\nThe steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare. Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold.  Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent.\\n\\n For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range. My experience with Table 17 were excellent.\\n\\nI do like the French Countryside deco giving the interior a homey and farmhouse vibe.\\n\\nWe were greeted warmly at the door and the service was really attentive for the whole evening.\\n\\nWe shared:\\n\\nLamb Polenta ($14)\\nDuck Confit ($26)\\nVanilla poached rhubarb ($8)\\n\\nEverything was well prepared with great care. I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover!\\n\\nThe restaurant did get busy even on a weekday evening. I guess a lot of people were taking advantage of their prix menu $35 during Sunday and Monday with BYOW.\\n\\nWill definitely return when I am in the neighbourhood.\\n\\nPS: Thanks Amy L for the invitation wow this place is amazing for brunch, french style cuisine, free parking on side streets even on weekends! bonus! i didn\\'t know there were coupons and deals at this place as I was reading the reviews but I would still pay full price to come here, gotta try dinner someday. good vibe here, good neighbourhood, good food! no line-ups for brunch either I wanted to go to Table 17 since I moved down to Leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go. My party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately that\\'s how the night continued. The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn\\'t receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn\\'t even order. There are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday what a surprise! I had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean. What I loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil I have tried I can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil. \\n\\nGlad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it! I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently. I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrée. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. \\n\\nI ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.\\n\\nSteak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. \\n\\nI had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purée and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. \\n\\nFor dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon\\'s saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.\\n\\nOur other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crème anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious. \\n\\nIt was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether. I can\\'t wait to go back. After trying to find a table at various downtown restaurants downtown and frowned upon for expecting to \"walk-in\" on a Saturday night we happened to find parking (another surprise for a Saturday night) right in front of Table 17 as if it was meant to be. We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm,  and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window. The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor.\\n\\nThe menu isn\\'t extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts. It was decadent, luscious and big enough to share (but who wants to!).\\n\\nA great evening and I am glad we didn\\'t get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks! My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.\\n\\nOur hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It\\'s not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn\\'t make it too loud.\\n\\nThe menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you\\'re going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.\\n\\nThe service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There\\'s one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they\\'re good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)'],\n",

       "  'Smashed burgers done properly in the heart of Weston village. Very happy that we have a spot like this now in the area. All the right elements that make a great diner style smashed burger ( freshly ground steak on site, no fillers, execellent layer of crust on the patty, can\\'t forgot to mention house cut fries ) . I opted for the signature z- burger ( double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion strings,z-sauce)with an order of Greek fries( Caramelized feta,evoo, and what I think was tzatiki sauce, awesome) , my partner went for the sorry eh burger( bacon cheese burger, fried egg, tomato, onion string and z-sauce) with a classic poutine done right.  Definitely worth trying this place . The burgers here are the best burgers I have ever had, to top it off the service is even better. I was in the car waiting and the cook brought us the food when he didn\\'t have to. Overall I will be coming here again! Great fresh burgers seared on a flat-top, and excellent fresh-cut fries and poutines, served up by an owner who cares.\\n\\nFreshly-ground daily, a 4oz. scoop of AAA beef is dropped on the flat top then smashed flat and seared until it\\'s nicely crusted, then served on a sesame seed bun. \\n\\nThe beef is juicy and flavourful, but not dripping with grease, like some places. Mark the owner tells me that he purposely set out to make decadent angus burgers, trying to keep it healthy, without sacrificing flavour.\\n\\nTheir poutine is huge, featuring thinner fresh cut potatoes, double-fried and topped with legit fresh white cheese curds and delicious beefy gravy.  \\n\\n*Don\\'t forget to check-in to take advantage of the 15% discount special.\\n\\nIn a city where gourmet burger places are popping up every day, this is one of the good ones. Definitely check it out and help keep this place alive, we need to keep joints like this around and successful. Finally checked out this place yesterday after hearing great reviews about it... and it did not disappoint! My husband had the Z burger, I had the Heat burger and we shared the chef\\'s poutine. Everything was amazing!!! Patty was very fresh and cooked to perfection and the toppings just topped it all off! The owner and his father were both so fantastic and went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying everything! The place is very clean and lots of room for seating. The mama in me also noticed a high chair which is very convenient for families with babies/toddlers :) Definitely check this place out! Nice to see some good spots being put in Weston... will definitely be back soon!!! Excellent and friendly service and even better burgers! Tried the Z-burger and it well surpassed my expectations. Highly recommend Zeal Burger. Really good burger and fries. Always fresh, you can tsste the quality of the ingredients. Reasonably priced for what you get. Will be a regular customer. Love this place! Got their Signature burger, The Z Burger but the mini one! Their Z sauce is like a Big Mac sauce but way better!! I wish I lived right next to this place. Can\\'t wait to try the Dunamis burger next! Had a Z burger with a fried egg and guac, one of the best burgers I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of devouring. The smell of those burgers on the flat top would make a vegetarian reconsider their dietary choices. I\\'m ecstatic that they opened a legit burger joint in the Weston and Lawrence area. I love the area, grew up there, so any new business, especially one of Zeal Burger\\'s quality, is a welcome addition to the \\'hood. Thumbs way up guys keep it up! You deserve every star. Believe the hype. Just had the zburger and poutine, if you want want a real filling homemade touch than this is the place. I definitely have a new hamburger stop, maybe I can can get a job there just to eat the food!!? \\nCheers! This was an amazing experience. The server/cook is such a friendly and caring host. He consistently makes sure that his customers are enjoying the food. He also makes sure the food is nice a presentable and treats every order and burger with perfection. I\\'ve tried The Heat and it\\'s a pretty solid burger. It\\'s a nice mix of ingredients. The fries were also pretty good. The area is spacious, clean and well maintained. \\n\\nI\\'ve never met someone who is so dedicated to perfection when it comes to serving food. I will most definitely be returning. The dude here is the nicest guy. Knew everything about the food and made us feel welcome. Burgers were amazing and worth the extra money. Skip Harvey\\'s for this. Tastiest burger I\\'ve ever had! I highly recommend this place, you won\\'t be disappointed:) Honestly the best burger joint I\\'ve ever been too, hands down! I came here a couple months ago for the first time. I ordered the Sorry Eh burger and told them I prefer no egg and they were more then glad to leave it out. The feta poutine was amazing as was the Nutella milkshake! Very friendly owner and the other guy was as well! Keep up the good work and wish you all the best in the future! This is by far one of the best burgers in the city.  I live in the area and been meaning to try these guys for a while now.  Finally went into grab their Zeal burger with bacon and cheese.  OMG!!!! This burger was juicy with tons of flavour and cooked to perfection.  That was yesterday and I went back in for another one today -had to it was too good.  Might even go back tomorrow for another!!!\\nVery clean place and great service!! Highly recommend to any burger lover.  \\nPS\\nAte it too fast to take any pics to post. I read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try. Absolutely the best hamburger I\\'ve had in a long long time. Love the fries and the feta, the beef is grilled with a nice crust. Very friendly guy behind the counter, he walked us through the menu and made some recommendations. I am so happy that this place is so close to home. Just had my first ever Zeal burger - I never did a review before but I felt like I had too here!  From the second I walked in with my guests, we were greeted with a great friendly smile!!!  The burgers were cooked in front of us and looked soooooo good!!!!  The fries are cooked to perfection and the burger is definitely memorable!!!!  100% recommendation!!!!! This had to be one of the best burgers I\\'ve eaten in a long time! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I can\\'t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to people. First time here since the Sang\\'s Chinese restaurant at this location closed. Nice 50\\'s decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which \"chips\" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he\\'s trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don\\'t like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that! Burger patty is ground from AAA meat and made daily you can tell from the taste that it is fresh. Fries are not greasy. Burger was done right not overly seasoned or drowning in toppings. I can tell the cook/owner loves what he\\'s doing as you can see and taste it in the food. Customer service was top notch, place is very clean. I live in Markham and will drive to this place again probably next weekend!! Wonderful service with a smile. The owner does everything himself (two thumbs up). One of the best best burgers in the city for sure. I wish they were open later though, just a thought. Excellent - so happy I discovered Zeal Burgers.  Much better than 5 guys or other places (and much more inexpensive - everything is included in combo!).  Meat is superb, bun is the freshest and fries are homemade, non-greasy.   The eating area is also extremely clean and cheerful. I don\\'t live in the area, happened to discover it when I was visiting a friend but will certainly be travelling here all the time - certainly worth it. Fantastic burger! Definitely on par with five guys and I would say it\\'s even better. The z burger had delicious onion straws and all the ingredients were fresh. The texture of the patties were unlike any place I\\'ve ever been to, a must try!\\n\\nAlso worth a mention, the fries are very tasty (not greasy like most places). I didn\\'t get a chance to try the Z poutine but it sounds like perfection. So I was randomly in the area, I had some time to kill waiting for someone so Zeal  Burgers was in area,  claiming they were great gourment burger and after having the Z Burger I cant say I disagree\\n\\nThe Z burger was a double cheese burger, two fresh grilled 4 oz patties, topped with their onion \"stringer\" Which is their take on mix between fried onion and onion rings, so it still is deep fried but not as large as onion rings, which is tasty add with their z sauce it was an amazing burger Ordered the \"Sorry, Eh\" burger with fries and it was a really solid burger. It was cooked perfectly with a nice fried eggs and their signature Z sauce is a much improved version of the Big Mac sauce. Their fries were a little bit bland, but still acceptable. Although a bit pricy ($10-15 usd) I would highly recommend this place. Loved these burgers!  Fresh ingredients, flavours mesh perfectly for a mouthwatering experience.  My kids loved the fries and their cheeseburger. My husband devoured the spicy burger even though he \"wasn\\'t hungry\" and I loved my feta.  We will go back often.  The owner is a great guy, made us feel really welcome as we had just moved to the city. Good food, good people, good prices. About 14$ for double patty and a couple extras and fries \\n\\nThe parking is a bit tricky if you don\\'t wanna pay since the location is located on a main street'],\n",

       "  'Zimmerman\\'s is my local grocery store, and while I try my best to avoid going there (for various reasons) somehow, I end up there a few times a week. \\n\\nThe reasons why Freshmart is inferior to other grocery stores:\\n\\n- They never ever have sales on anything. No flyers, they don\\'t accept coupons, they are getting the most money from you possible\\n\\n- Their selection sucks. I have been there many times that they\\'ve had no ground beef. COME ON! Ground beef?! Really they just don\\'t have enough of anything! \\n\\n- Their deli service is questionable. One of the workers scares me a little! I haven\\'t seen him around recently though, so maybe they figured out he scares the customers\\n\\n- The cashiers are touch and go. There are two (I think they owners) who are really abrupt and unfriendly. Then there are two younger people who are super friendly and personable. If you have a choice, go to a younger cashier! \\n\\n- Cleanliness - not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but this place never seems fully clean... \\n\\nSo, if you have an opportunity to get a drive to Metro, do it. The sales there will also be better priced than Freshmart, which makes it worth the journey. If you have to go to Freshmart, just be prepared to pay through the nose for your every day needs. \\n\\n.. and you\\'ll likely see me there. I think this might be the unhappiest place on earth. It never seems to have what I need, has bad prices and the staff seem miserable. I have been a loyal customer of Freshmart for the last few years. I just noticed that they have filled the void created by the closure of European Quality Meats and Sausages. Freshmart now carries their full line of products. The only difference their meat counter is self service. You don\\'t have to take a number and wait. As to their prices they have without question the cheapest prices in the area. This is my local grocery store, and it is arguably the worst grocery store in Toronto. Why?\\n\\n- Understocked: Half the time I go in there, they don\\'t have standard items like 2L 1% milk or cottage cheese.\\n\\n- Expired goods: When they do have what I want most of the time the expiry date is 1 week away. It\\'s very rare I get what I want with a reasonable expiry date.\\n\\n- Highly overpriced: Everything from soda to toilet paper is way more expensive than even Metro or Loblaws.\\n\\nI used to be a huge opponent of Loblaws opening a store near Kensington, but with this being our only option, coupled with the fact that 90% of the stores in the market are only open until 7-8 (and even earlier in the winter), the people in this area sorely need a reasonable grocery store open.\\n\\nIf you happen to be unemployed, Kensington would be a great place to shop. But for people who work until 5-6 and then have an activity after such as going to the gym, shopping in Kensington is an impossibility. It\\'s extremely frustrating. Sketchy looking place at a first glance and it is indeed sketchy. I have had money stolen from a cashier (Kalsi, a middle-aged woman with brown skin and is roughly 5\\' 5\".) working at Zimmerman\\'s twice in the past year. The first time, I let it slide. The second time, I contacted management (Martin Zimmerman) and he simply ignored me.\\n\\nJust so that others do not get scammed the same way I do, I will describe how I had money stolen. I gave her a $20 and after she put the bill in the cash register, she claimed I only gave her $10. When I insisted otherwise, she got hostile and accused me of trying to take money. What she will tell you is that the manager will count the money and if there is surplus, she will contact you. An obvious workaround for her is to pocket $10 before the manager counts.\\n\\nIf you are paying with cash, I suggest you have the cashier identify the cash amount you are giving her. Have her verbally affirm that she sees the amount you are giving and better yet, record it with video. Closest thing to a typical grocery store in Kensington. Not too big but they\\'ll have most things you\\'d need. They never really have sales, but the prices aren\\'t TOO bad. Obviously you\\'ll want to get your produce somewhere else in the market. Open until 7pm.\\n\\nObligatory Title Pun: ZIMMER down!\\n\\nMenu Readability: Oh, so not applicable.\\n\\nNeed to mention: Minimum order of $10 to use your CC or debit.\\n\\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I moved to a part of town with absolutely no grocery stores. Major props to Zimmerman\\'s for being open on Christmas, NYE and Thanksgiving!\\n\\nI stumbled into Zimmerman\\'s one Christmas while searching for baking trays. I had gone to Chinatown in the hopes that something that would be open would sell baking trays, but sadly my hopes were mercilessly dashed. Zimmerman\\'s being open taped up the broken pieces of my heart!\\n\\nIt\\'s a normal grocery store and seems adequately stocked. The prices could definitely be lower: I was happy to pay for the premium of being able to buy things on Christmas afternoon.\\n\\nYou can\\'t use debit unless you purchase $10 worth of goods, but that\\'s understandable at an establishment of this size. \\n\\nThe owner is a friendly guy and runs an A-OK grocery store. This store hasn\\'t changed in years!  It\\'s still the depressing and overpriced store that I remembered from my earlier years, but I stopped in to take a browse since it has been a long time that I visited.  No wonder it has been a long time!\\n\\nThe interior is a decent size with spacious aisles and some-what stocked shelves, but selection of brands is limited. The way the shelves are setup so far apart, makes the store seems a little bigger, definitely lots of room in the aisles.\\n\\nLocation is convenient if you live in the neighbourhood to get some staples in the market that other stores doesn\\'t offer. If you don\\'t have time to go to one of the bigger grocery stores and don\\'t  mind paying the higher prices for convenience, then this store is for you.\\n\\nI\\'m really surprised that Zimmerman\\'s has survived.   I wonder for how much longer? I am laughing so hard right now after reading the Edie review where she mentions the staff are \"disabled\", I, personally, hadn\\'t noticed, but I\\'ll look more carefully next time, maybe that cute blond that just started working there has a hidden peg leg.... I think not.  \\n\\nThe only thing I really buy here on a regular basis is milk.  Most other things you would need such as toiletries and cleaning supplies you are much better off buying in bulk at a wallmart, if that notion doesn\\'t offend you, and buying your meat and veggies at smaller stores in kensington market.'],\n",

       "  'My boyfriend is taking me here tonight because we\\'re celebrating something and I thought, \"all I want is Kenzo.\"\\n\\nEven if you have to wait- it\\'s rarely for very long.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the seafood ramen (I forget the actual name of it and I picked the squid out), which gave me acid reflux but it was soooo good. I had the King of King Ramen which is spicy to say the least- but delicious. My favourite is the Wonton Ramen- it\\'s not in the menu, but there\\'s a poster of it on the wall.  Best broth ever!\\n\\nAt least as good as Kinton, only you don\\'t have to wait 3 hours to get a seat. Admittedly, I\\'m not much of a ramen connoisseur but felt that this restaurant offers good quality ingredients, generous portions, and an inviting ambiance at an affordable price. If anything, the broth was a bit on the salty side, but perhaps that\\'s just how it\\'s supposed to be done. I had the king of kings ramen, which was just spicy enough to my liking and rich enough to satiate my hunger by the end of it. Kenzo Ramen is a great soup place. When I\\'ve had too much Pho, Kenzo is a great place to find an alternative to my staple soup eating patterns.\\n\\nI particularly love their big monster Ramen soup which I, unfortunately, can\\'t remember the name. It\\'s a huge bowl of mixed ingredients which is a great way to please my complexity loving pallet. \\n\\nTheir food is very good, their prices are reasonable, and I\\'ve never had an issue with their service which is always prompt and polite. \\n\\nAlthough some say that you should never go to a soup place on a date, I would argue that Kenzo is a great option for such an occasion. :) I ordered tonkatsu don and agedashi tofu. Felt like eating rice instead of ramen today \\n\\nFood : 4/5 \\nIt\\'s pretty good and decent, the portion is fairly medium. \\n\\nService: 5/5 \\nEverything came fairly quick, and all the staff are responsive. \\n\\nPrice: 3/5 \\nI think the tonkatsu don is a bit pricy. Kenzo Ramen thank you for popping my first ramen experience cherry!  The location was great and just walking distance from Wellesley station.  Service was quick and attentive.\\n\\nYou have to wait a bit before you can eat your ramen, it was steaming hot! The broth was delicious!   I thought the ramen was great but I was told later than Kenzo is middle of the road for Japanese standards.  \\n\\nDespite being a ramen newbie, I will be back to Kenzo for a cheap dinner or lunch. 5 stars for service\\n3 for ramen\\n\\nI came here with 4 friends at 10 pm and the kitchen has closed for the night, but they were able to open it up for 5 bowls of ramen. Yes! Excellent service.  Charm and Aaron were amazing servers and didn\\'t rush us even when we were holding them from leaving work.\\n\\nIt\\'s not the best ramen I\\'ve ever eaten but it does it job at 10 bucks a bowl and it\\'s only 50 cents to add an extra egg. One of the few viable options on Dundas between Spadina and Yonge St., and a plausible destination at which to recharge after a day of horrible, horrible, but unavoidable shopping in the Eaton Centre or visiting the AGO if you don\\'t want to venture into Chinatown, especially in the dead of winter.  I\\'ve been twice, and I don\\'t see why I won\\'t be going back several times.\\n\\nThe King of Kings ramen is rich, spicy, and chock full of crunch and tasty tidbits, including sliced and ground pork and a nice egg.  The servings are *humongous* -- bring an appetite, or prepare to be defeated and exhausted as you dive into a bottomless bowl.  The noodles are passable; I\\'ve certainly had better.\\n\\nMy friend, who recently ate his way through Japan, said it compares favourably with what you\\'ll get at most places there, and I would rate it just slightly lower than my favourite of all time, Saiwaii Ramen in SF.\\n\\nThe Osaka octupus balls are *insanely* rich, and even six is far too many for two people, consisting as they do of soft cheese (I only found out later that this is what they are made of ... glad I didn\\'t know before I ordered them ... also since when do Japanese dishes involve dairy?!?) doused in super-sweet teriyaki sauce.  I loved the shaved dry octopus on top.  Oddly, they were a little bit like small melted, spherical seafood okonomi (PS: see my review of Okonomi House for the genuine article).\\n\\nThis is not a cheap fill-up, but it\\'s probably the best value in this neighbourhood (which exploits suburban shoppers who don\\'t want to venture too far from Yonge & Dundas when they come to town), and even worth a visit if you live elsewhere in the city.\\n\\nThe tables are small, and it\\'s pretty busy, so I can\\'t really recommend it for a party of more than 2-3. I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and the soup and the pork were great. The noodles not so much. And I also order Gyoza and they were amazing!! I would need to try other ramen to rate better, because they have plenty of types of different ramen. Definitely, I would recommend it! Yet  to say I tried this out of the blue one cold winters day after shopping. I loved it the service was well eventho it was busy and the portion sizes for the noodle is well worth it. I\\'d like to say I\\'m a huge fan of this place. Broth is very nice (though a tad salty in my opinion).\\nNoodles aren\\'t chewy enough for my taste but still good.\\nMeat and vegetables and such are pretty good. They messed up my order.  Then you have to explain over and over again what they did wrong.  And to top it up, they offend you and call you a liar.  Apparently they can\\'t do wrong.  The worst service ever! Craving ramen for awhile since its hard for me to get good ramen in town. First stop visiting downtown Toronto was Kenzo Ramen. To be fair, from the outside it resembles any other ordinary ramen shop lined along Dundas Ave. While not completely Japanese owned, this place is able to hold its own and have a loyal fan base. \\n\\nI ordered the Tonkotsu, Broth was tasty and delicious, not to mention healthy. No MSG from what I can tell, noodles were firmly cooked, not too soft or mushy. Portions were just right, satisfying and filling but not overly wasteful in portion wise. Would recommend going back. I usually go to the one in Mississauga but this location is great too. I love ramen and i can\\'t remember the one i always get but all of them are delicious! I like how their chopsticks are not the cheap wooden ones. The matcha smoothie is not that good but i think its more on how it was done Came upon this place by accident, as I was visiting 401 Games located next door, and decided to give it a try.  Overall I would say this place is a fairly standard when it comes to ramen; the pork was tender, the egg was not overcooked, the noodles were nice and chewy.  I had their King of Kings ramen and the broth was flavourful but missing that depth and richness you get from a really good broth, but again it was overall decent - the ramen itself also had lots of other stuff in it as well (veggies, seaweed, ground pork). The service was quick and friendly, although I was one of two tables eating at that time.  There are definitely better ramen places in the city, but overall Kenzo is not bad if you want a quick bite in the area. This place is alright - portions are bigger than Santosei but quality is lower than that of Kinton. In a pinch, it should do to quelch any ramen cravings. Not real Japanese food including donburi and ramen. Service is not that good. But the taste is not so bad. I will still go there for a quick lunch Tried Kenzo for the first time yesterday. Went to the 522 Yonge location. \\n\\nThere was no lineup at 5:15 pm (yay!). Had the miso based Ramen. It was good. The broth was delicious and the pork was very good. \\n\\nI will definitely go back and try the other varities.  I was so happy to see that every other patron in the restaurant was Japanese or Korean. So I am taking that as a sign of authenticity. After a long exhausting walk my girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to something special. We decided to give kenzo ramen a try. \\n\\nWe ordered Sho-yu Ra-men (7.95) and The King of Kings Ramen (12.95).\\n\\nThe broth for Sho-yu was nice and tasty and the ramen noodle was made very nicely.\\n\\nRather disappointed overall though, The king of kings ramen had a tasteless instant noodle tasting broth. It was as if someone mixed water with chill oil. \\n\\nThe waitresses were leaning on ambivalent about serving us seriously.\\n\\nLet me assure you downtown has a lot of options, Will not be coming back. Decided to have dinner here tonight after walking around aimlessly looking for a place to eat! I live around the area and did not even know this place existed along Yonge Street! I had the sho-yu ramen and it tasted great, it wasn\\'t too salty, it was just right. The customer service wasn\\'t the best but I\\'ll give the guy a break as he was the only server. Prices are pretty reasonable, my ramen was $7.95! Kenzo is a great ramen place in Toronto that rarely ever has line ups and the service is super quick.  I usually frequent the Bloor location, but the first one I tried was the Yonge Street spot.  The place is pretty clean inside and looks like your standard ramen house decor.  The staff are friendly, but you\\'ll have to call them over at times as they are usually busy with the kitchen or serving.\\n\\nThe ramen here is a little greasy, but the taste is pretty good.  The broth isn\\'t as clean as I\\'m used to with places like Kinton and Sansotei taking over as my favourites.  Also the various toppings aren\\'t cooked as well or as delicately as those shops I\\'ve mentioned.  They add more of a Chinese flare with their vegetables and toppings over the traditional Japanese ramen, but it works well.\\n\\nIf I\\'m in a pinch and need to get something quick to eat Kenzo is a good place to go.  the ramen portions are also the largest out of any other ramen shops in the GTA and their fried dumplings will fill you up alone.  The price is right and the food is good, so definitely give this place a try. Simply the BEST ramen in town and gyoza was delicious too!\\n\\nI\\'m just not a fan of the place. It\\'s quite an uncomfortable awkward narrow place so may not work if you have a big group. \\n\\nBut I would still go back for some awesome ramen. I love Ramen, but this place wasn\\'t anything particularly special. The price is right, the place is clean and the servers were nice. When it comes right down to the food though, I wouldn\\'t recommend it any more readily than other options for a good soup in the area. Not bad, comfortable enough seating and the ramen was tasty. It also came out super fast. I\\'m no ramen afficionado by any stretch, but I enjoyed my meal. great ramen, fast but nice service It was a bit expensive, but it is a really good soup. Definitely a lot better than anything at pacific mall. There are vegetarian options so yay!. I\\'m vegan so they were kind enough to remove the noodles and substitute with more bean sprouts and rice on the side. My roommate and I came here before Nerd night for a quick snack. We both opted for the King of King Ramen. I like Ramen and it was decent with alot of textures, including the egg, the noodles, the pork and the seaweed. Broth was okay with a bit of bite. It was good and filling but I will keep looking for other options! Enjoyed eating there for the first time with couple of friends, the ramen was pretty good for the price. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area. If you\\'re looking for a simple and good tasting noodle soup dish, this is the place to go. The kitchen operates well and seems to be able to fulfill orders quite quickly. Prices for the ramen dishes are also fair, if not very affordable. I would recommend going with their recommended menu options as they truly are delicious! My girlfriend and I came here on February 24 at around 2PM. When we arrived, the place wasn\\'t that packed and only 3 tables were filled. After we sat down, a mob of people came in and almost half of the restaurant was filled! After we were seated, we took a quick glance at the menu and decided what to order. Our waitress was very attentive and took our orders promptly. I went with the Nagasaki Champon (Seafood) and my girlfriend went with \"The Kings of the Kings Ramen\" (she\\'s so fancy)! I also ordered the Matcha Green Tea Smoothie. \\n\\nMy green tea smoothie took about 10 minutes to come out and it was kind of too bland for me. It had a milky but not too sweet green tea taste. It was good, but just not my kind of drink. Our food came out probably around 15 minutes after we ordered it, which isn\\'t too bad. My seafood ramen was awesome, mostly because I love seafood and the soup base tasted great. It came with a decent amount of seafood (Shrimp, scallops, and mussels) and noodles. One minor complaint I have is that the shrimp should be unshelled, this makes it easier to eat especially when eating ramen...or maybe I\\'m just picky! As for my girlfriend (she\\'s a picky eater), she thought that it was just okay. They could have gave less toppings, primarily the bean sprouts because it seemed like there were more of that than noodles. Another thing is that she didn\\'t like the smokey flavor of the pork, but that depends on your taste. One thing that we both agree on is that the noodles had a great texture to it, it was an awesome smooth and soft texture.\\n\\nAs for the service, I thought our waitress did a great job. She accommodated with our requests and was very attentive. She came back often enough to not annoy us, but enough for us to request items if we needed. Our ramens didn\\'t come out quick, but it wasn\\'t so long that we would complain. We also got a coupon for 5$ off 25$ the next time we visit :)\\n\\nOverall, I had a great time and meal at Kenzo. If I am ever in the Toronto area, I would definitely come back here and try the other ramen. Not only was the is service great, the food was delicious as well. Definitely a place to check out if you\\'re around the Toronto-Downtown area. Well this place is good, but I don\\'t understand the high ratings. I found their soup to be slightly salty and the portions somewhat small for the price. But like the other reviews mention, the service was EXCELLENT. Super attentive staff. LOVED this place!!  Everyone was super friendly, and we even chatted with a couple that was seated nearby.\\n\\nSo, there\\'s a ramen contest here-eat an entire bowl at a level 20 in regards to its spiciness, and get it for free.  Our server warned us that it was REALLY spicy, so I got a level 2 (I was sweatin\\' a bit, to tell you the truth!  And I always get spicy ramen that never tastes that spicy!!) with pork and mushrooms, and my boo got a level 6 (I think that was the 1st tier haha).  He was dying and I had a few spoonfuls and YES, it was THAT spicy.  But it was still tasty, at least!\\n\\nWe also got an order of the gyoza, which was huge size wise! I love soups and sometimes ignorance can truly be bliss. \\n\\nI know my way around Pho\\'s and Pork Bone soups, however Ramen, I can\\'t say much except that I enjoy them. As such, I do happen to like Kenzo. \\n\\nBoth times I have been there, the new location has been mostly empty --including dinner time here, so I would take most people don\\'t know about this location yet, even though it is listed on their website.   \\n\\nThe first time I was there I had a Netsu Ramen which --with limited experience found to be very tasty. The second time I had their Orochong (\\'cause youth love it ;-) ...which I found good but I actually preferred their Netsu better. Mind you that is a matter of taste, not quality. \\n\\nOn a positive note, the waiter came after our meal and asked what we thought of it. If perhaps it was too salty or if there was anything they could do to improve the dish.... WHAT? Really? For better or worse, I cannot even remember when was the last time I was asked that in a restaurant. It was appreciated, however due to my lack of Ramen experience, I really could not give any meaningful feedback. \\n\\nAs far as quality, I could not how \"authentic\" it was. I could only assume that it is not. But unlike places like Pho88, where their pho is neither authentic or that well made, this simile of Ramen was quite delicious given it\\'s lack of authenticness. \\n\\nIf you have never been to Japan then I very much recommend this place. However if you HAVE been to Japan, chances are that you know better and probably just come her because the selection in Canada is so slim. \\n\\nHaving said that, I will keep an eye for other Ramen places to expand my palette. However next time I go back, I will have check out the King Ramen. I really have never paid so much for a bowl of noodles!!  2 bowls of noodles and an appetizer for $45!  I could\\'ve gone to an all you can eat restaurant for that price! And u wasn\\'t very impressed with my noodles. There wasn\\'t much to it. Some noodles, some ground pork, some extremely salty broth......  It was suppose to be spicy but was far from it.  The takoyaki balls were pretty good though......hence the two stars! We didn\\'t try the ramen, but we had the Gyoza and Takoyaki. The dishes were fine, but not surprisingly delicious. Maybe we expected too much. People who know Toronto well said they won\\'t suggest this restaurant as a good place for Ramen. Amazing service and food. Place is well maintained and has AC -  so bless. The portions are perfect and very filling- and that\\'s coming from a person who can eat a lot. Warning the portions are big for the more expensive ramen. The cheaper ramen are still filling though even if you\\'re pretty hungry. Good taste and perfectly chewy noodles. Decent ramen although cannot compare to Sansotei. Its cheaper and good for lunch, noodles and broth are only average. I did really like their onigiri but they\\'re really small. It is opened by Chinese people so technically it is Chinese way of Ramen...so, having a semi-cooked noodle is not a surprise...I left half of the bowl there...and those 2 stars are for the dumpling, which is fully cooked....if I have to give its ramen a star, I would give a -2! Go there for dumpling or DanDan noodle if you are really out of options, but not Ramen... Because there is no half point, I gave five points. It worths 4.5 points. I like their ramen variations. I had Tonkotsu ramen and it was good. The soup base was port bone and it was yummy. One of my group had Yakisoba and it seemed really delicious. It\\'s impressive to have a good Japanese ramen in the heart of Toronto and the price is also reasonable. It is recommended, definitely. Really recommend Nagasaki!!!  Green tea latte is really really good, but way too expensive for what you get! The Kenzo chain in general is \"OK\". Don\\'t let that deter you, I don\\'t mean to attach any negative connotations with \"OK\", I really really just mean it\\'s OK. Considering ramen options in Toronto in general, it\\'s pretty good.\\n\\nI like the atmosphere of this Kenzo a little more than the other ones. It\\'s easier to be seen by waiters than the one on Dundas and it feels less gaudy than the one on Bloor. Every time I\\'ve been there it\\'s also been quieter, with parties usually from 1~4 people. This might be why the waitresses are sometimes distracted talking to each other though, and they don\\'t notice if you\\'re looking expectantly their way with your meal done right away.\\n\\nI usually just opt for their more basic ramens. My main complaint about Kenzo ramen is it\\'s got too much going on. Too many bean sprouts, too much saltiness to the broth, etc. I can\\'t taste that hearty pork bone flavour in the tonkotsu ramen as well as at J-Town because of this. As a solution I always order shoyu or shio ramen and water down the broth with some water.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a ramen newbie, don\\'t worry, the food is still pretty good. If you\\'re picky about your ramen, you may not be too impressed by Kenzo, but it\\'s not too bad, especially when you\\'re really craving some ramen. Kenzo Ramen is beginner level ramen.  It\\'s what \"california rolls\" are to sushi.  If you\\'ve never had ramen in a restaurant before (as I haven\\'t), it\\'s a good place to start.  I can definitely now imagine the levels of complexity a ramen bowl could reach - just not so much here.\\n\\nThings I liked: the service.  Such good service!!  Really 5 stars for that.  I liked my matcha smoothie, although it could have been more liquidy.  I did like the ramen, but it did have a \"one-note\" broth and the toppings weren\\'t so insanely delicious.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but next time I want ramen, I wouldn\\'t choose Kenzo, I would choose to go to one of the many popular joints I keep reading about. Lots of flavour, the freshness can tasted, and very quick and pleasant staff. Alot of the places on young around this area are still hit and miss, but this is a sure keeper if they keep the quality up and the prices under $12. Only thing I missed was some free kimtchi to calm the hunger during the wait. This place is pretty decent.\\n\\nI really don\\'t know what makes this place stand out to be honest. The restaurant itself is decent, the ramen is decent, the service is decent, and the prices are, again, decent. It\\'s nothing to write home about. I wouldn\\'t choose this place to introduce my friends to ramen or anything like that.\\n\\nIt\\'s a decent place to eat if you\\'re in the Bloor-Spadina area, but if you\\'ve got a better place in mind, I\\'d go for that instead. The Netsu ramen I ordered was full of flavour and had generous amounts of ground pork, vegetables, and noodles. The noodles were chewy, and the pork was marinated just right. \\n\\nOne real downside to my noodles was that although they tasted amazing, my throat is reeling from the sodium and I\\'ve downed several glasses of water as a result.\\n\\nThe decor is quite nice as well. Since it was early on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was half-empty and relatively quiet. The tables are well-proportioned so that you don\\'t bump elbows with everybody at your table. \\n\\nWait staff were friendly, and had the initiative to ask when we were ready to order, whether we\\'d like a glass refill, and how we enjoyed our meal. #detox\\n...... will not go again\\n\\nTakoyaki tasted nice..  but something is wrong with the pork in ramen.. 本來打算跟朋友到日式放題的餐廳享用晚餐，但是發現我們原本想去的那餐廳要等位，那我們只好到對面街的這家拉麵店吃晚餐。普通拉麵（鹽拉麵、醬油拉麵和麵豉拉麵）的價錢都比我預算中的便宜。由於我那晚非常餓，我點了鹽拉麵之後就加一元吧我的拉麵份量加大。雖然這家餐廳所選用的麵條是幼面，但是吃起來後感也不錯，但我自己本身是比較鍾情粗麵條的。鹽湯底不但不太鹹而且挺容易入口。吃完整碗拉麵之後我感到非常滿足和飽滿，整個身體也立馬暖了起來。如果大家是在找普通、飽肚的拉麵的話這家店是不錯的，但是如果大家是在找日本質素拉麵的話那我就會建議大家去其他的拉麵店享用。 Ordered the Unagidon for $14.95 which includes salad and miso soup. The eel was fairly good, but I still think it lacks a bit of taste. Service was really good considering we were really loud and didn\\'t got kicked out. The waitress was nice and patient with us, answering all our questions like a professional. Actually I will not say it gave me very strong impression. Ramen was average, price was a little high than I expected. Environment is also average. I will not say I recommend or not, but if you walk by and never try it before, then you can give a try. I got the Netsu ramen in medium and boy was it spicy! Next time I\\'m getting mild. It was still decent although I\\'m not a fan of the noodles. Decent portion size. I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen as well and I preferred that. The broth and meat were delicious in that one. It seemed a bit small especially for the price. Kenzo is a Ramen chain store in Toronto. I think it is good if you crave ramen but do not want to wait. I never had to wait for a seat at Kenzo and the food comes pretty quickly (under 10mins every time). It is a good fast food. As far as authenticity goes, it is not that authentic, it has some chinese food elements in it.\\n\\nThe broth is ok, it is definitely less flavorful than Santouka or Sansotei, but Kenzo is also much cheaper, gives you more food, and you have no wait. It is also close to my home, so during cold winter nights it rakes points for convenience. The servers are always friendly and polite and service is prompt. It is clean. The noodles are the wheat types and are decent, most times it is not overcooked.\\n\\nOverall a good place for a decent, quick and cheap meal, but do not expect mind blowingly great ramen here. With a sudden ramen craving that fell upon me, I decided to check out where the closest ramen joint to my work was with my handy dandy Yelp app. Luckily for me, Kenzo was less than 5 minutes away, hurrah!\\n\\nYou may not notice Kenzo if you\\'re not looking for it, it\\'s easy for smaller spots to get lost in the hustle & bustle of Yonge St, I find!\\n\\nService here is easily 5 stars. My waitress was super sweet, attentive, and friendly.\\n\\nLots of solo eaters and small tables, so if you are popping by on a quick solo lunch, or even just wandering the area solo looking for a bite to eat, Kenzo is ideal.\\n\\nI went with the Tonkotsu ramen (which came within MINUTES of me ordering! Wow! Talk about speedy!) which was tasty, though I felt the pork could have used a bit more seasoning. \\n\\nMinus a few points because a.) I think the floor must have been very recently washed because it was quite wet and I almost slipped walking to my table - no signs warning about this - eep! &\\nb.) Got unlucky with a wobbly table (those drive me bonkers!)\\n\\nAll in all a solid 3.5/5. One of the better lunch spots in the area, not to mention some of the best service. I will most certainly be back! I was recommended to go here by a friend who enjoys it here. \\n\\nThey have several locations so I am going to go on the assumption that quality may vary based on where you are. I\\'m going to flat out say that I did enjoy my experience here and I really did enjoy it. I had more than enough food at my disposal and I left a full man upon completion of my meal. I think the pricing is on point, any more would be theft and any less....would also be theft come to think of it.\\n\\nIt was a bit grungy but there isn\\'t anything wrong with that if you can get past it and the food is great. What I really liked about it was that there is a heavy emphasis on vegetarian options that are available which is great! It\\'s rare to see in a ramen place which focuses typically on pork, chicken and beef broths. \\n\\nI do reccomend this place to all. There are better ramen joints in the city for sure, but this is DEFINITELY one of the better places for sure The food was excellent as well as the service, especially on a cold night. Got a ramen Bowl, gyoza and onigiri and all were delicious. My girlfriend got the yakisoba and she said it was quite tasty (it certainly looked good). Would definitely come back here I love ramen and ramen for $7 is awesome in my books. It\\'s fast to get the food, fast to eat, tasty, delicious and cheap. I highly recommend the pork bone soup. So today I visited Kenzo  Ramen Noodle house on Dundas Street West for lunch .I enjoyed the seafood ramen noodle soup it was okay but nothing special it looked much better than it tasted. I had a level 2 spice factor, wasn\\'t very hot at all ....maybe next time I\\'ll try level 3. My waitresses were very friendly and very attentive. I did not like the actual restaurant itself .....it felt too small and too cluttered and I didn\\'t like the open kitchen concept ....I don\\'t like to see my food being prepared as it kind of grosses me out. \\nI definitely will be going back again I want to try some of the other soups that they have available I definitely want to try the level 3 heat factor soup that they advertise and everyone gushes about. \\nFor my stupid one Sapparo beer my meal came up to about $22 kind of expensive for lunch especially when I\\'m eating by myself. So no real complaints I\\'ll be back! There was a time where I absolutely loved Kenzo as it was the only ramen choice in downtown..... Now that kinton and sansotei and others will be in town, the bar is a bit higher and....meh, Kenzo\\'s alright. Too skimpy on the pork, but the rest of the toppings are tasty. Would eat there when I\\'m lazy since I live nearby but would rather trek to Kinton on a nice day. Been a while since I had Japanese food that wasn\\'t sushi. Also been a while since I\\'ve had anything spicy. I fixed both those issues at once with this place. Reasonably price with very friendly and kind hearted staff that create some of the best Ramen this side of the Pacific. \\n\\nI had the spicy bowl and they have three levels of spice. I chose the lowest one and was still sweating by the time I was done though I did have some level 2 as dipping on the side. Keep in mind I am a lightweight when it comes to spicy food right now. \\n\\nThey have about 20 or so different dishes, mostly in the ramen soup variety. Either spicy or non, also vegi is available for most. They have non bowls as well I didn\\'t have them so don\\'t know how they stack up. Ramen for less than $10? This is definitely the option for it. There are a few options under $10 here, like the Miso Ramen (7.95), the Shoyu ramen (7.95), and some of the spicy rames that for 8.95. So if you\\'re craving ramen and not too picky of the taste, not a bad choice.\\n\\nI picked the Miso ramen, and it was quite meh. The broth is fine, the noodles are fine, the meat was fine. Nothing was \"bad\" but I don\\'t come for ramen to feel \"fine\". The ramen comes with 3 pieces of pork, a piece of seaweed, and a little bunch of bean sprouts. I kept thinking....where\\'s my egg!\\n\\nMy BF ordered the dippable ramen, which was much better. I think it was about $12.95? But the dipping sauce was delicious, and came with the half egg, and a more flavourful pork than mine. I ended up stealing some of his dipping sauce to upgrade my ramen a bit.\\n\\nAll in all....everything is fine. But for better ramen (albeit more expensive), there\\'s some only steps away up and down Yonge St. The king ramen had a lot of stuff and delicious but too spicy for my taste.  Couldn\\'t enjoy the noodles due to this. The rest of the menu didn\\'t seem very appetizing and the yaki soba was too sweet.  More fast food tasting. Came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nThe gyoza was simply amazing. The meat to wrapper ratio was absolutely spot on and worth the $9. Loved that they were pan fried and came with 2 saucers of dipping sauce!\\n\\nI ordered the King of Kings Ramen bowl and that was extremely filling and satisfying. The noodles were cooked perfectly and was neither mushy nor too underdone. The broth could\\'ve been spicer (will ask it to be spicer next time) but was well balanced otherwise. Only complaint was their liberal use of salt. \\n\\nStaff were swift and courteous, refilled our water glasses without being asked.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back. The food isn\\'t bad.   Unfortunately the service is just not there.   Rushed out of dinner and wouldn\\'t even take dessert order when there are still other to let there.   Not to mention I told the waiter when I started. Probably won\\'t go back. Enjoyed myself thoroughly! Waitress was very kind, not much interaction though which was fine. Ramen was tasty but subtle. They were nice enough to give me a side of minced chilli to put into my bowl for some heat. Will be coming back for sure. Ramen is hitting this city like a nuclear explosion (too soon?)\\n\\nI haven\\'t tried many of the new ramen joints so I can\\'t compare, but for a reasonably priced and (up until now) unique soup in the core I recommend either of Kenzo\\'s locations.\\n\\nThe menu is small and simple. You\\'ll be getting ramen noodles in soup with a variety of extra, some spicy, some savoury. If you order a non-spicy dish they\\'ll happily bring you their chili powder to bring it up to taste.\\n\\nAgain, I\\'m no expert, but I happen to think their tacoyaki is top notch. Love it.\\n\\nGreat in the winter when you\\'re looking to warm up or if you want to clear your sinuses....or really just anytime because it\\'s delicious. It\\'s good salty Ramen but as a meal you should order 2 bowls because its basically all noodles and very little meat or veggies.  There is so much salt that I taste it in my mouth for the rest of the day. THE KING is a great soup..\\nDundas location is SUPERIOR...  The decor/setting.  Yonge location had really bad dancey/pop music playing, way way too loud and completely ODD for the environment, completely annoying.  In the end a one time visit.  Stick to the BLOOR or DUNDAS spots.  simply better... I\\'m a big fan of Japanese ramen consider its something my mom has made since I was young. Nothing like having a hot bowl of noodles and delicious toppings on a cold day.\\n\\nI\\'ve frequented the dundas location and the yonge st. one. Both are very good, but here\\'s my thoughts on this loc. I\\'ve ordered in the past the tonkotsu, sho-yu, shi-yo, miso and one last one I can\\'t remember.\\n\\nPRO\\n- Much more spacious than the dundas location, so getting a seat is less of a hassle\\n- Less busy when I went here (around 7:30) so serve was prompt\\n- Can\\'t say food was much different, but again consistently good for a fair price\\n\\nCON\\n- Not positive, but I thought the matcha iced latte was made better at the dundas location\\n\\nThe Sho-yu is my fav and good if you don\\'t want something too big. The tonkotsu is also delicious but much more filling. This chain is surprisingly decent considering the people who run it are not Japanese. Good ramen chain a variety of ramen. Tried the seafood ramen and the tonkotsu ramen. The seafood ramen had great seafood flavor and plenty of shellfish. The tonkotsu ramen was fine. They didn\\'t use the thin white noodles that would be traditional for richer broths like tonkotsu. The pork was a slice of plain shoulder. The broth itself was not as rich and didn\\'t have the collagen it should have had. Good ramen especially if you in the mood for it and many locations around Toronto. I\\'m a huge ramen fan and I was disappointed when I went to Kenzo yesterday. \\n\\nI had the Kings of King Ramen with a spicy level 2/3. It was really spicy though I\\'m Chinese and can take a quite a lot of hotness. Moreover, mushrooms and meat in the soup tasted smoky, not in a good way. They tasted like they were over cooked and the fire was way too hot for them. \\n\\nOverall, I don\\'t think I will ever go back there. This is some of the best ramen in the city, and they serve Takoyaki to boot! I was so happy to discover there was a location in my neighbourhood in addition to the one near my work. This Kenzo is a little small and crowded, but the ramen is just as tasty as at the Bloor location. I like Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and the king of the kings  ramen, the soup of Tonkotsu is better than the king of kings, but king of kings is like a value pack, you have everything in it and the quantity is big. Kenzo Ramen is the same as the Japanese Noodle House Chain.\\n\\nI tried the Sapporo Miso Ramen at $10.95.  The description of the dish is very accurate.  The dish consisted of very rich miso soup base with mixed stir fried veggies. There is a choice of pork or chicken slices as well as a vegetarian option.\\n\\nI chose chicken and was very pleased.\\n\\nI went at lunch time just at opening.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely return to try the other ramen dishes especially in the winter or any time I need a rich hot soup to warm the insides. Well fair price for ramen. Very friendly waitress and fast service! Would recommend this to friends! Great food and service... We ordered few sups and octopus appetizer and everything was absolutely amazing.. I highly recommend this place This Kenzo Ramen seems to be solo eater\\'s heaven!\\n\\nNot only it has tons of tables for 2 which are perfect for single, there were in fact 5 tables of single while I was eating there. \\n\\nWait staffs are a lot friendlier than the other locations I been to, especially the Dundas location.\\n\\nMy Netsu Ramen ($8.95) level 3 spicy also a lot spicier than the one I had in other locations?! The noodles were chewy and cooked al dente.....really warmed me up on this cold winter\\'s night!\\n\\nAnother great Ramen location if I have a Ramen Attack!! Wasn\\'t the best ramen I\\'ve had in Toronto - I like Sansotei (on Dundas) better.  However, they have a lot more options to choose from, so if you want a variety of ramen, come here.  I prefer Tonkotsu or pork bone broth based soup, and I thought Sansotei or Santouka does a better job with the soup base.  The noodles itself were good but the meat was average -- it could have been more flavorful.  One of the must get items here is the fried gyozas.  They were much larger than expected and were very flavorful.  Didn\\'t really enjoy the octobus balls.\\n\\nService was mediocre since my gyozas and octopus didn\\'t come out until after my friend and I finished our ramen.  Had we not asked them about it, I think they would have forgotten about them! I freaking love Ramen. Authentic Ramen. But since I am no longer flying to Japan every weekend, I\\'m a beggar and not a chooser now, am I? And what are ramen beggars left with? Kenzo.\\n\\nThis new location used to be the home of Bowl, a pan Asian restaurant (and shall I mention I served there for a while? ha). The new owners did not change much in terms of layout/design. The location gets + points because it is simply much more spacious than the Dundas location, but - points because it feels a little less like a Ramen House and even less authentic (wow didn\\'t know that was possible).\\n\\nFood is alright; the menu is identical to the Dundas one. I could go on and on about how ramen in Toronto is just not good enough and too expensive (I am SUCH a ramen snob, even bigger than I am a sushi snob)... but seriously when my choices are as slim as Kenzo or Ajisen, I still regularly - albeit half-assedly - satisfy my cravings at Kenzo. Now I just have a location that is even closer to my home!\\n\\nIn terms of side dishes, they are really average. I would recommend to just stick to the noodles, and don\\'t try their \"fancy\" green tea drinks either. My personal favourites are always Miso, and Tonkotsu. But guys, you really gotta go to Japan.\\n\\nAtmosphere - 2/5\\nService - 3/5\\nFood - 3/5\\nPrice - 3/5'],\n",

       "  'Ok food and great service. The owners, family and staff really make the difference. Duncan is a great host and a pleasure to talk to. Small but comfortable atmosphere. \\nGate 403 brings in wonderful jazz talent and they promote young talent. \\nKeep up the great job! A very talented and musical friend of mine was playing a jazzy show here and I rarely if ever pass up an invite to hear live music. Almost every day of the week at Gate 403 you\\'ll be sure to happen upon a few local jazz artists or bands who are simply playing their music for the love of it. Not only do I find this endearing, I also think it\\'s perfect for those who wish to support local talent in Toronto. \\n\\nWhile Gate 403 is not a large space, it fits a nice crowd of people who are either there for the food or for the music. Both are safe bets if you ask me. Gate 403 is a mix between a pub and a piano bar and it seems to have something for everyone. Come in for the food and stay for the tunes, either way you\\'ll be happy you filled your ears and of course, your belly. Let me be clear, you come here for the music and vibe--not the food or service. Casual drinks or a date its a great spot. However, if you are planning on having dinner this is not the place. Very few waitstaff so the service is slow, even when they are around they are not attentive. Who brings over two waters for a table of four? food is typical bar fare and it is mediocre at best. If this place didnt have live music I really couldnt see a reason to come here unless i was desperate for a pint. Very cool bar with great live  jazz music, the servers r nice & nice selection of beer on tap Awesome place!! I used to basically live here Tuesday nights for Julian Fauth!\\n\\nI held a business christmas party here and was taken care of BIG TIME!!!\\n\\nlove the owner, barmaids and everything about this place...\\n\\nCalamari?? meh....its better for booze and tunes... Came with a group of friends on Thursday night (they had a bar rail cocktail special for $4)! You can\\'t go wrong with $4 drinks and great company. Ordered the signature burger with fries, fish tacos, calamari and bruschetta.  Overall, the food and service was awesome! The burger is definitely a must try, especially with their fresh cut fries. Yummm Love the food here and the service is great.\\nI attend the Saturday Afternoon (5-8) Blues and roots sessions quite often.\\nAlways find a few faces I know in the crowd. I am super surprised to be one of the very few 2 star reviews for this place... \\nAs a place to grab drinks and listen to live music, I\\'d be willing to give this place a 3 star but the food and atmosphere were not the best.\\n\\nI ordered the cheese Quesadillas (a commonly known safe bar food option in my opinion). It was very small for $9 price tag that came with it (three pieces) and every ingredient tasted like it came from a can (think pizza pocket!)\\n\\nMy friends ordered the garlic bread with cheese and the wings and again both of them said they were surprised about how bland the taste was.\\n\\nMy recommendation is eat before or after coming here and just come for the band.... Food was mediocre at best, not to mention far too pricey. I had ordered the burger with a side of fries and a drink, but instead received a salad instead of fries. When inquiring about the mix up, I was told \"You happy? No? You eat salad\". After being ignored for the next 20 minutes and subsequently eating the salad I was served, I finally managed to convince the owner to give me my plate of fries. The service was excruciatingly slow, though the supposed \" jazz\" (a single piano) was okay. \\n\\nOverall I give this restaurant bar a rating of 2 stars, since I did eventually receive my fries. The Gate has good and bad points, but every experience I\\'ve had here has been positive. I gotta urge ya to sit at the bar; it\\'s often a rewarding experience, had a great conversation every time. The music is often excellent, and it\\'s really the reason you go, though the placement of the stage doesn\\'t work well - it\\'s too close to the bar, so it\\'s hard to walk between the bar and the larger tables in the back. Frankly it gets inordinately loud, so beware. \\n\\nBeer prices are excellent (usually $2 below the Local across the street) and they know how to mix drinks - most of the time. The food is nothing to write home about, but I\\'m there for music, company, and drinks, so I don\\'t mind. Very disappointed in this place. Food was incredibly bad and way too expensive for the quality we got. Definitely not going back again. We came here on a Sunday night for a live jazz performance and casual drinks.  It wasn\\'t too busy so there was plenty of seating.  The jazz band was situated right in the middle of the restaurant so you could sit infront or behind the band.  No cover to see the band but they pass around a tip jar.\\n\\nService was friendly and quick.  They have a good selection of beers on tap with pints ranging between $5-8, fancy coctails priced at $8.50 and house wine for $5/glass.\\n\\nFood menu has the basic pub food with a few entrees.  I don\\'t know if I would come specifically to have a meal but it\\'s an option if we\\'re looking for snacks like nachos, fries or wings. I\\'ve been stopping in here for an after work drink quite frequently of late. First of all: they have an actual happy hour from monday to thursday, with the added bonus of half price appetizers til 6. My regular bartender Jasmine is top notch, and I\\'ve always found the music to be pleasant but not overwhelming in terms of sound level. Recommended. A lovely evening out.\\n\\nI would suggest reservations... particularly since visibility to the live acts is limited.\\n\\nHowever it is a nice place to explore if you are in the area and enjoy jazz, blues and folk music. \\n\\nIf you\\'re down in the area, give me a heads up...I\\'d be happy to try and connect with you. While waiting for a table at Barque we came across Gate 403.  Is the 403 in reference to Calgary?  Perhaps the owners are from out West?  \\n\\nThere is live jazz nightly, though on this particular night (Friday night) they would only be on until 9PM.\\n\\nThere is no cover to see the band, but there is a tip jar.  The bar itself has a good selection of beers (both on tap and bottled) and a list of cocktails and wines.  \\n\\nThe music was pretty good.  The crowd was mixed.  You had couples, you had solo-ers, and music lovers alike.\\n\\nCan\\'t comment on the food as I didn\\'t have any. Laid-back non-pretentious atmosphere. The venue is a bit small for everyone to see the performers but the atmosphere is intimate and homey! This is a terrific restuarant with amazing music. Everyone who loves Jazz music should come here to try the music and the food which is beyond my expectation ! Gate 403 Bar and Grill is a hidden gem in Roncesvalles that host live jazz and blues 7 nights a week. Performers include #Juno award winning artists such as Julian Fauth! Check out the calendar on their website to see the performance schedule, they\\'re really good about updating it! \\n\\n403 SIGNATURE BURGER 4.5/5\\nPENNE PESTO 4.5/5\\nBRUSCHETTA 4/5\\nCAJUN SHRIMP 2.5/5 (could be because I\\'m not crazy about shrimp)\\nBBQ WINGS 3.5/5 (regular bar wings)\\n\\nI tried their burger (Ground rib eye, pancetta, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, arugula, tomatoes, aioli served on a multigrain bun) and fresh cut fries ($14). Whenever I have this combo, regardless of how good the burger is (and it was pretty darn good), I focus more on the fries than the burger, is that weird? \\n\\nAnyways, I like my fries with a thin layer of crispiness on the outside and meltingly mushy on the inside (and not the powdery type of mushy). When fries have thick layer of crisp on the outside, it reminds me of my highschool cafeteria fries, which is not my preference. Gate 403 hit the nail right on the head with their fries, I will go back just for them.\\n\\nAnother solid entree is their penne pasta with red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes and baby kale in olive pesto sauce ($13). If you order this, do NOT forget to add the sausage (+$3), which is optional (but come on, it really isn\\'t).\\n\\nI also quite enjoyed the Bruschetta with Feta cheese, vine tomatoes, roasted garlic & balsamic drizzle ($9). The bread was crispy and the topping was seasoned perfectly. It seemed to be a rather big portion of bruschetta though, it can definitely be shared. \\n\\nGate 403 also serves cocktails, martinis, sangrias and mangrias (the male version of sangria)! \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for parking, there is a greenP lot within walking distance nearby. Love this place in theory... but the music is SO loud that it makes it tough to enjoy a great conversation along with your martini and jazz...  (BTW: I\\'m not even an old fart yet... I like my music loud and this place gets on my nerves).  BUT, if you don\\'t want to talk, it\\'s great for live jazz....  The food is OK - nothing to brag about but not a problem. Oh dear. I went on a Friday evening in April, expecting to hear Jazz. What I heard was so far from it. The band was driving people out of the bar. No Jazz, unprofessional music. I have been several times before, and they occasionally have good bands that actually play Jazz, but mostly it\\'s a big miss music wise. \\nService is good, food is okay but perhaps expensive for what it is. But the biggest let down is a Jazz bar booking non Jazz musicians. Toronto is not devoid of good Jazz musicians! I\\'d stay clear of this place until they get a real booker and some better music. Great live Jazz every Wednesday!  Terrific atmosphere and very friendly people. \\n\\nGo for a drink and enjoy the live music. Year after year, still love this place just the same if not more. The food, music, and service have only gotten better. Coming here is so warm and welcoming, such a great vibe. Toronto is lucky to have a hidden gem like Gate 403 :) While I think that, overall, Gate 403 is a great bar, the above four stars is not for the bar as a whole, but for the bar on Tuesday Nights.\\n\\nWhile Gate 403 has a revolving selection of live jazz, for free, every night of the week, Tuesdays are especially great, as they are the night Julian Fauth plays. Tuesdays have been, for the last few years, a regular destination for myself and many others on and off the Roncesvalles strip, due mostly to the fact that Julian\\'s style of blues (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZarpCUeykI, but this doesn\\'t really do the live setting justice) is so great for either letting sink into the background as a wonderful setting for conversation and drinking, or for sitting quietly at the bar and attending to. \\n\\nBesides that the bar is notable mostly for great and friendly bartenders (except for Kate, who is really great and unfriendly), the fact that there is free music every night, and a good cast of nice regulars. Great that they have live jazz music. The curry coconut ratatouille was delicious and priced fair. They only had one server when I went but service was still very quick. Definitely wouldn\\'t recommend the food here. \\n\\nDrinks are a fair price.\\n\\nMusic isn\\'t bad on weekends. \\n\\nService started out amazing but by the end of the night we had to pay with another waitress as our original disappeared into the night. \\n\\nOverall - not terrible, but not amazing either. So far, this is the best place I have found to hear jazz on a Saturday night in Toronto.  You can still hear your conversation or you can focus on the music.  The drinks are great (as is the service).  Plus, it is a short walk south from the subway.  I\\'m eager to try the food--it looks good. Came here for dinner and jazz with my friends who live in the neighborhood. It was not one of their best nights but the company was great and the staff were very friendly. The food was decent though nothing to write home about. The live band did play a few lovely songs and I can see how if I were a local I would enjoy coming here on certain nights when I expect the music to be good and would enjoy just sitting back with my glass of wine. when i am in the area this is one of my favorite places to stop by and chat with friends,  The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is good and if you are there on a friday or saturday night the music is intoxicating.  Even though i have not lived in the area for a decade, i still return every chance i get. Gate 403 is the definition of your cozy local bar. Always has a great crowd and live music. Has a wonderful array of drinks with bartenders who are able to conjure up drinks with funny names on a whim. The fresh cut fries are my favorite. I would say this is one of the gems in Toronto if you are looking to hang out with friends over good drinks and food. This place is ok if you just want to chill and have a few drinks and listen to  jazz. Be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going and be sure to be there on time and not a minute late because they will give away your table. The food is ok and the atmoshphere can be described as cozy if you like to sit at tables that are an inch apart.'],\n",

       "  'This place was very good before, but not anymore. They started doing $5 express takeout and $3 breakfast and last week they changed menu (not reflected on website yet). The original menu was good and food was great, but now they dropped the price by quite a lot (for example risotto from ~$25 to ~$15). I think this place has shifted to a cheap mediocre shop. Even though this place is no longer a nice dining choice of mine, I will try their express takeout just out of curiosity. My boyfriend got a good deal online for a 4 course meal for this resturant.  I have no idea whether they were under staff or not but that shouldnt be the issue, they couldve let us know for a heads up and not make us wait for each meal.  My first experience at vino rosso was horrible and this was on Valentine\\'s day.  Dont get me wrong, the food was great but the SERVICE was hell.  They questioned us back if we wanted water when we clearly wanted water and they shouldve given water when we first sat down, i think that is proper service 101 for any resturant. Literally took them 20-30 minutes for each dish to come out.  Whole experience was feeling agitated and anxious.  And the last course which was dessert, the order that came out for me was wrong and didnt even take it back and my boyfriend and i wanted was get the bill and leave asap by than, so thats what happened, asked for the bill when dessert came, stuffed it down asap and left.  The customers to the right wasnt too happy either about their service, when they sat down, they waited probably about 20 minute to take their order and they had to get the waiter\\'waitress attention.  By the end, we told ourselve that we wouldve rather stayed in and order take out and not have dealt with the experience and expecially how cold it was outside. A group of co-workers decided to go here for summerlicious, first of all, summerlicious is an opportunity for restaurants to put out there their best food so you want to come back and pay regular price for it....well this place completely missed the mark on that. \\nThe menu sounded appetizing but it began with the server bringing water to the table and proceeding to ask us for our food orders, that\\'s all fine but then she didn\\'t even ask if anyone wanted a drink (other than the water). Once our food came out it was a disappointment after disappointment, some food was cold, tasted like it had been re-heated and the best parts of anything was the sauces put on the food. \\nDefinitely not going back here. Visited Vino Rosso for Summerlicious. The service was slow even though my table was the only party in the restaurant (this should have tipped us off about the quality already). No kidding, the entire place was empty except for us! \\n\\nService started out well enough, but the disappointments came one after the other. Our waiter came with bread for the table but then came late with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and then again parmesan cheese as well. I am not picky about my bread but the constant disruption was not appreciated and made me feel like the service was lagging. I found myself frustrated again when (1) our waiter offered to refill our water and never came back with it (2) we had to ask twice to get the bill and (3) it took forever to get the bill, once again, considering there were no other tables in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe food was equally underwhelming. The bread was gross, nothing more to say. The Caprese Insalata was decent but nothing special. My main, a Penne Arrabiata, tasted like glorified penne swimming in spicy tomato sauce. Definitely did NOT taste like fresh pasta as advertised. And for dessert, the waiter had the gall to tell me that I was getting a chocolate cake (Tartufo), when it was just chocolate ice cream. I could\\'ve gotten much better for much less at a local ice cream parlour. So disappointed. Will definitely not be going back to Vino Rosso. A total waste of my money. \\n\\nPS. For those who care, they add an automatic 15% gratuity. We came here for summerlicious. The apps were the best part of our meal- crab cake and calamari. Both delicious. My dining companion had the lobster ravioli and I had the salmon. The salmon was a little over done. The ravioli was good. The trio of desserts were meh.\\n\\nAt some point I ended up with a bug in my wine glass. As soon as the waiter saw it, he got me a new glass, poured me a fresh glass of wine from the bottle and apologized for the incident.\\n\\nIf you are not in a rush and want to go to a place where you can hear your date talk, this is a good place to go. The restaurant was at half capacity, and we found the pacing and service just right. THE CUSTOMER ALWAYS COMES LAST\\n\\nI have not even visited this place and have a terrible opinion of it.  I would never set foot in it or speak well of the place as this restaurant in June wanted new customers so they offered a discount through Buytopia -- $15 spent for a $30 food voucher.  I\\'d been ill and so waited until I felt better -- the last weekend the voucher was valid. \\n\\nI called to make a reservation and was told that they had what I call a \"bigger, better deal\" -- when they had the opportunity to rent out the whole place for those days, they did so.  I asked the man I was speaking to whether the voucher would be honoured later than the expiry date, considering that it was their fault that I could not redeem the voucher.  He told me, yes, they would; then said, ask the manager, though.\\n\\nUh oh.\\n\\nI emailed the manager who said, yes, they booked the whole place but NO they would not honour the voucher after the expiry date (which THEY themselves, failed to honour, not I).\\n\\nIf you make a reservation, don\\'t be surprised if you show up and they don\\'t serve you because of...well, they\\'re greedy and unprofessional and lack common sense.\\n\\nI see this restaurant offering Groupon discounts, still.  BEWARE. I came here for lunch with a co-worker, the waitress (who has short black hair and a thick accent) seated us at our table and completely disregarded as for over 30 minutes, until I called her over asking for bread (that they always bring over), 7 minutes later she came back with 4 pieces of cold bread. She brought over our food, I ordered the chef\\'s recommendation which was the tortellini - the portion size was incredibly small and it only came with four thinly sliced sausages. My co-worker ordered the fettuccine with mushrooms (don\\'t remember the exact title) it was incredibly bland, basically it was fettuccine, some mushrooms, and heavy cream, it had absolutely no flavor. The waitress only offered us black pepper and did not offer us parmigiana cheese, when in fact she offered it to everyone else. When I asked for more bread, she came back 10 minutes later with more cold bread, I had to ask her to bring us fresh bread, she disappeared for another 5 minutes and came back with hot bread (which I\\'m 100% was just microwaved).\\n\\nAll in all, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not unless you really like bad service and bland tasting food. We had a three course meal here for lunch.\\nNothing special. The menu said \"crabcakes\" but it only came with 1 crabcake :(. The chicken parmesan was a bit dry. The dessert was not memorable. \\nThe service was slow. I ate 2 baskets of bread by myself waiting for our mains to arrive, and I was still hungry leaving this place...\\n\\nNot worth $25. Good value for money. Decent Italian cuisine. Rony gets a little old Italian lady to make his pasta and she does a great job on the gnocchi and his chef adds the red sauce. I recommend the veal Marsala. On the drier side, not the meat, I mean not so saucy but delicious and moist pasta and crisp veggies. Small but respectable wine list.  We had a 2011 Italian Barbera for under $50. Lovely desserts and pretty good espresso. I went here on Valentine\\'s Day. The service was so slow. It took them 20 mins to get my boyfriend and me water and we actually asked for it twice. For the 4 course meal, it also took so long, like 30 mins for each course. They has Valentine\\'s manu for that day but I asked for regular menu as well because I wanted to order something else. The waitress gave me the manu but when I finally decided what to order, she told me that they couldn\\'t do regular manu because they don\\'t have enough time. Anyways, the food is good; just the service. A quaint little restaurant. Very quiet which was expected for a weekday evening. Food was great with the waiter referring to the \"Ossobuco\" as magic meat. Well I don\\'t know if it was magical since I didn\\'t see any sparks or flying pigs (flying veal?) but it was quite a tender piece of meat. My friend\\'s whole wheat spaghetti was quite disappointing, such that she could not finish the dish.\\nOverall not bad for an Italian restaurant, but would like to visit again to try out other menu items. This is my first time rating on Yelp as I felt it is necessary to inform everyone about what I experienced in this restaurant. We made a reservation for lunch with a few of my coworkers. I\\'ve read on Yelp that this restaurant is very understaffed and they\\'re fairly slow on preparing the food orders. I didn\\'t expect to wait 40 mins for an appetizer; after finishing the appetizer, we were all waiting for the main course. We waited for another 20 mins but no food has showed up yet, and we asked the waiter if the food will be ready. We waited another 10 mins and realized that we have already been in the restaurant for over an hour and it had already passed our allowed lunch time; we have only had an appetizer. As a result, we asked the waiter to have our lunch to go. Since the summerlicious menu we paid for also includes dessert, we asked the waiter if we could get the dessert to go. He was extremely unhappy about it and told us that \"you can\\'t expect us to have your food ready in 25 mins! If you want dessert, you have to wait!\" (But we were there for over an hour). Overall, the food was not the best quality I had. It was not worth the money and time to go. Make sure you guys read Yelp before going! We came in here on a Thursday evening mainly because there wasn\\'t a large number of people here. We were hungry and figured we would be able to get our food fast.\\n\\nWe started with the soup of the day (a sweet potatoe soup) and ordered the grilled salmon with pasta and eggplant parmesan (a special of the day) to have for entree. We asked for a recommendation for what to have with our meal and were recommended a red wine. The soup tasted good flavour wise but could have been a little creamier and less watery. Both main were good, but it was a little surprsing that the eggplant parmesan wasn\\'t served with anything else (no pasta? no rice?). It tasted great (I love eggplant), but wish I was told that so I could order something to go with it. We didn\\'t think the wine went well with the meal, and it was a little sour as well (the perils of ordering per glass I guess). For dessert we ordered the house made tiramisu. I liked that it was not overly sweet.\\n\\nThe service was friendly. We split the soup and dessert and they were nice enough to split the soup into two bowls rather than just give us another spoon. It wasn\\'t as fast as we had hoped, but it wasn\\'t necessarily slow.\\n\\nOther thought: It is a little dark in the restaurant. I guess that\\'s the ambience they want there, but a part of me thought it was a little too dark. Went here on a Tuesday using a Travelzoo voucher. The portion sizes are small. The appetizers we had were small but tasty. I ordered the NY Striploin medium and my associate ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon. The steak was a chewy and my associates Salmon looked cooked but was raw inside. They tried to recook it and made it worse, it was now so chewy that my associate lost her appetite. \\n\\nOn the other hand the service was good. There server was empathetic and tried to make it right, but there is only so much he could do.\\n\\n\\n**EDIT**\\nAs per the Owners Response. I did mention above I used a TravelZoo voucher. The owner mentions that no bill was bought to the table. He is correct, we already paid $49 for the voucher, so more than 3/4 portion of it was already paid for. My comment was for the food alone, I would like to point out is the Salmon was RAW inside, not medium rare. As far as I know in Ontario food must be cooked well unless advised by the customer (for steaks, etc). So unless I am mistaken, what I read from the owners response, is that if you do come here for any special or voucher and if the food turns out to be uncooked, you do not have the right to be upset or post any negative reviews. Came here on a Thursday night with a Buytopia deal for a 3 course meal for 2 people that comes with a glass of wine or beer.\\n\\nI wanted to call ahead to make a reservation but the phone number for the restaurant does not work during the day, it rings once then goes to a recorded message \"Sorry the number you have called is not a sign\". I called almost every hour from 12 until 5pm and finally by 6pm, the call gets through. Super weird!\\n\\nWhen we got there, the place had a few tables, but the vibe felt very empty. There was one server working all night. She seemed like she was either new or have barely any experience at all. She gave us the set menu to choose as we showed her the deal. She came back every 5 mins asking if we were ready and every time we would say we need more time. We asked for water to start off our meal and we didn\\'t get it until 15 mins later after we ordered. And we had to remind her one last time before she came with it, most likely have forgotten when there\\'s only one other table in the restaurant.\\n\\nShe brought over some bread, which seemed like its homemade with a little olive oil drizzled on top of it. But as I took a little bit into the bread, I spilt it right out!! It was SUPER SALTY!!!\\nLike it was dipped in salt or something!!\\n\\nOur appetizers came which was the grilled calamari and crab cakes. BOTH were SALTY as well! Calamari was cold topped with some homemade salsa which tasted like diced tomatoes and onions tossed in olive oil. There were canned grilled red peppers on the side but they were cold as if they literally came out of the fridge. \\n\\nThe crab cake was one round piece size of your palm cut in half. I only tasted potatoes, corn and carrots. There was no crab or didn\\'t see any sight of crab. Tasted like I was eating potato cakes instead. SUPER DISAPPOINTING!!\\n\\nThe mains came, which were a tapilia and 7oz steak, both with vegetables. The tapilia was dry and tasted like it has been in the freezer for ages, it had a FREEZER TASTE! The steak was cooked at the right color but it tasted stale and you can tell by the texture that it\\'s an old piece of steak. The texture felt like it was a medium well when I ordered a medium rare, it looked like a medium rare though, which I got so confused. The steamed/boiled vegetables were the WORSE!!! One big piece of brocoli that had to be boiled for over 10 mins, it was MUSHY like baby food! The carrots were also OVERCOOKED and MUSHY, also like baby food!! The potatoes were yukon gold, cut up into BIG chunks, some were also overcooked so it was MUSHY but there was one piece that was RARE, CRUNCHY when I bit into it. WORSE VEGETABLES I have ever eaten!!\\n\\nDesserts were a tiramisu and new york cheesecake. The cheesecake tastes okay since you can tell that it was store brought and not made in house. The tiramisu tasted okay but texture was SUPER MUSHY!!\\n\\nOverall, EVERYTHING IS BAD!! FOOD IS SALTY, MUSHY, totally NOT SUPPOSE TO BE WHAT IT TASTED!! The waitress was weird all night, everytime coming to the table making it very awkward; either trying to rearrange the dishes to make it seem more convinent for us but actually not, trying to ask us about the food but reacting in an awkward way, it just made us feel UNEASY!\\n\\nWILL NEVER COME BACK AND DON\\'T SUGGEST ANYONE COMING!!!! First let\\'s mention that this place offers halal meat and does not serve pork. They do use wine to cook but if you mention that you eat halal, they can make substations for you.\\n\\nNow, I came here with old colleagues for summerlicious and to catch up. We made reservations for 6pm. When we arrived, one of party was running late. But the server kept coming around to refill glasses and check up on us. When everyone was here, however, they tried to rush us into ordering a little. Eventually they stopped, to the point that we had to then call them over when we were all ready to order.\\n\\nThe excellent part is a lot of us were torn on what we wanted. They were really nice and offered us to somewhat combine dishes. They usually offer a substitution for the steak, instead of mashed potatoes and veggies you can get pasta. But the pasta is usually like penne. Thy graciously allowed us to have lobster ravioli as out pasta side. Two pieces of ravioli (the actually dish has 6 pieces) with our steak. We even got complimentary veggies to share amongst the four of us.\\n\\nThe downside to this great offer was that I ordered a medium steak and got something closer to medium-well. And the lobster ravioli wasn\\'t that great. Although the sauce was amazing.\\nFor our apps we had gotten calamari, meatballs and crab cake. The crab cake was a bit lonely, just one cake. The meatballs were good. But tiny and only four. The calamari was delicious!\\nThe most pathetic part of our meal was the dessert. When put together it was pretty yummy, esp the ricotta gelato. The brownie was okay and the poached pear looked like tuna sashimi on the plate. It was yummy but two pieces of it was too much for the tiny dollop of gelato. I wish they hadn\\'t presented it deconstructed on such a large plate.\\n\\nSo the food was hit and miss. My negative comments relate to the service. We were very pleased with the service until we finished dinner and dessert and no one came around for ages. Then they went to get four bills and did come back for another 15 mins. In the meantime I had to use the washroom. When I saw there was no toilet paper, I went back to notify one of the employees there. She said okay, but did not go to replace the roll. I had to borrow wet wipes from a friend to use their washroom ...... That is not good service. ESP in a restaurant. That isn\\'t bustling with diners. Lastly, I paid in cash and it took another 15 mins before my change came around and we could finally leave.\\n\\nThis seems like a nice place, but it also seems like they won\\'t be open for long. The food was okay, the service averages to okay. They weren\\'t busy. I won\\'t be going back. It\\'s harsh to say it, but it definitely doesn\\'t look like a business that will last.'],\n",

       "  'We were there for Groupon. The service was very good from the ladies. That\\'s where it end. The atmosphere is very poor. The lighting makes me feel dull. The cook doesn\\'t even know how to make the atmosphere enjoyable. It seems like he just want to get the cooking over with and barely have a smile. He price is definitely high for the cooking and taste of this restaurant. Went there with a groupon.  Including the cost of groupon it ended up being 50$ a person.\\n\\nService: (5 stars)\\n+ great accommodations with the weird groupon rules - 4 of us went with 2 separate groupons and they were accommodating to have us at the same table. (they did not have to)\\n+ the bill included tax and tip and they notified us of the tip ahead that tip was already added .  \\n+ generally friendly\\n\\n\\n\\nFood: (4.5 stars)\\nThese were all the food that we have gotten: \\nMiso soup\\nHouse salad with ginger dressing\\nChef\\'s selection sushi roll \\nAAA Strip loin Steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, jumbo shrimp, and Atlantic scallops\\nTeppanyaki vegetables\\nVeggie Fried rice\\nJapanese Ice Cream (Mango or Green Tea)\\n\\nThe protein was pretty small, we got 3 shrimp, 2 scallops, and the rest was cut in small pieces so unsure how much of food it actually was.  However it was enough to leave all of very full at the end of the meal.     Scallops and the steak were my favorite.\\n\\n\\nAtmosphere (3 stars):\\nThe person who was serving us was nice, however he only did a few trick (onion volcano, and bouncing the egg on the spatula)  You can see the video: https://youtu.be/0gakol3OuGU\\nThe place was clean, I just expected more of a show.  \\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nThe groupon was cool due to different protein\\'s that we got, but compared to the regular menu seemed just slightly under the normal cost. These guys are great & they took our party of 40 without deposit without advance notice & gave us excellent service. The food was excellent but the thing that impressed me the most was that when I told them about my unique yet deadly allergy to raw carrots, they took it very serious & cooked all my food separately in the kitchen. Service was amazing! The food preparation was exciting and entertaining. For st asters we got signs and dumplings and for my main I had the AAA filet mignon and it was impeccable! I highly recommend this restaurant and the dish! Had a great experience! Service was amazing! It was great to watch the chef do his thing right in front. Food was delicious as well. Can\\'t wait to go back! Great service and delicious food. We enjoyed our time there. I truly recommend this place for birthday celebrations and friends hangouts.. Servers were very nice. Our chef was hilarious with his tricks and jokes and the food was amazing! Overall great experience!\\nFood was delicious. We had the select 2 combo and chose chicken and steak. The chef was entertaining.  Service was friendly ATROCIOUS. The service was slow, disorganized and inattentive. We ordered sushi as an appetizer which arrived after our soup and salad. The sushi was far below average - don\\'t even touch the yellowtail. As we waited for our appetizers our wine came even slower and apparently sharing a glass of water is a thing. The other people at the table all received their cooked appetizers before the meal. The teppanyaki chef was dull and rushing to get through our table. Sadly he wasn\\'t in such a hurry as to cook our filet mignon rare as ordered. In short nothing went well. The food was bland, poorly prepared and presented. If I could, I would have given this no star. I am a big teppanyaki fan and have been to many other teppanyaki restaurants outside and inside of Toronto. Yet it was not only the worst Teppanyaki experience I have ever had, but also one of the worst restaurant experiences overall..\\n\\nIt\\'s been few weeks since I had my first (and hopefully the last) visit to Hibachi. Two of my girlfriends and I came in right on time for our reservation. The hostess approached us then said our table was not ready. It was understandable at first since it was a busy friday night. She had us seated at the bar and we ordered a cocktail each just to kill some time. Everything was great until then. The cocktails were tasty and we were all in a good mood. We didn\\'t know it\\'d take more than 40 mins for them to actually \"get our table ready\". We finished our drinks after 20 mins and very kindly asked the hostess when our table will be ready. She said she will figure it out for us then left us for another good 20mins without giving us any heads up. After some time, FINALLY the other hostess (different one from the one who sat us at the bar) told us the table is ready and we HAVE TO settle our bills before we leave the bar. So we settled our bills. \\n\\nWe were seated at the table and not after so long, the server approached us. We already knew what we wanted and ordered. He said we have to wait for the table to be filled. So we waited.. again. Skipping to the conclusion, the whole process of waiting for the other customers to arrive, to order food, and to actually have the chef show up to the table took ANOTHER 35 mins. We were starving. \\n\\nThe show began and it was just mediocre. Same old onion volcanoes and some other basic tricks that you see at other teppanyaki restaurants. For food, we ordered a green dragon roll to share as an appetizer, then fillet mignon for myself and two other things from their teppanyaki main menu for my friends. The green dragon roll, I still remember just because of the poorly cut avocados on top of the roll. Wanted my fillet mignon to be cooked rare and turned out to be cooked medium. My friends and I were actually too tired out to make complaints by the time we were served. The food, to be honest, was not the worst but not the best either. \\n\\nIn total, it took hibachi 75MINS to put just any food into our mouths. I understand how the teppanyaki restaurants work.. but this was just overwhelming.\\n\\nAnd yet, the best part hasn\\'t come out. We were just about half way done eating when we heard something unexpected. Apparently, who seemed to be like the manager or the supervisor was YELLING at one of his staffs in front of all the  customers. It was really REALLY uncomfortable to witness the whole yelling, shouting, and swearing while eating. Yes, swearing. We didn\\'t finish our food. We just asked for the bill, paid, then came out.\\n \\nThe staffs were nice and friendly, but that is actually the only nice thing I could say about this place. If anyone wants to try teppanyaki, just go somewhere else. It\\'s just not worth it to spend the amount of time and the money for such place. We had been eyeing the new Hibachi Grill which opened up this fall at the Thompson Toronto, as we literally live a block away. So on my husband\\'s birthday I decided to make reservations.\\n\\nWe ended up going with the prix fixe menu, with some upgrades. This  includes soup, salad, fried rice, sushi rolls, ice cream on top of the grilled meats and veggies. The fare was pretty standard for a hibachi grill, steak, chicken, scallops and shrimp. They did add lobster to the mix, which was nice touch. The scoops of ice cream were nice-sized, which is good cause my hubs loves ice cream.\\n\\nThe most entertaining part of course were the antics of the chef juggling his tools and setting food on fire. (See the two videos I posted.) I had previously asked to add on a birthday package, but as the evening drew to a close I saw no sign of it. Even my mother-in-law commented that a candle and cake would have been nice. A couple of gentle reminders later, the wait staff did serenade my husband with drums, a chef hat and really nice green tea cheesecake (yes, with a candle ) They even gave us a framed photo, which was a nice memento of the evening.\\n\\nThe only down side was that although mostly courteous, there is a little bit of a language barrier with some of the wait staff. This was a bit unexpected given the venue. None-the-less, it was a really fun evening.\\n\\nMy Rating: 3.5/10. 1.5 points deducted because food although good, was pretty standard, no delectable surprises. 1 point deducted for wait staff forgetting the birthday package and potentially embarrassing me in front of my in laws.\\n\\nPro Tip: When you make the reservations, ask to purchase coupons at the door. You get a 2 for 1 deal on the prix fixe menu, which works really well with the wallet. Nice ambience and service. I am not a teppanyaki lover so I didn\\'t particularly appreciate the effort at show-cooking but I am sure some people would.\\n\\nThe food was good (I had a mix of scallops, prawns and lobster), I actually enjoyed the small starter of sashimi so also the raw fish bar could be worth it.\\n\\nPrice was okay. Delicious meal! I dined here with my boyfriend this past Saturday! I got the salmon combo, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken & scallops. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The portions were huge! Definitely get your money\\'s worth. Excellent service, our chef Justin was awesome! Really good first experience, and I will definitely be back soon!!! I have to say that what really got my attention was the service. Our server was exceptionally friendly, and good with customers overall. I had just wished the chef would have been more enthusiastic. There may have only been 4 people at our table, but the show just seemed a little lacklustre. The egg toss and fire volcano were nice, but the performance just felt very \"let\\'s get this over with\".\\n\\nAside from the service, I have to say the food was a bit of a letdown. We used a Groupon that listed a $140 face value for 2 people, which is a HUGE inflation.The food was just average.\\n\\nSad to say that I\\'ve had better miso soup and Japanese salad at AYCE restaurants.\\n\\nThe chef\\'s choice roll was pretty decent. I\\'m not sure if it was chicken or shrimp tempura, but the roll tasted okay.\\n\\nThe teppanyaki I must say provided a substantial amount of food with LOTS of variety. Lobster, shrimp, scallops, chicken and steak cooked the way you want it. They give you dark and light sauces to dip in. The dark tastes like typical steak sauce, and the light tastes like a thousand island mayonnaise variation. Without the sauce the food is rather bland. While it has a nice charred flavour to it, a little salt or seasoning would have been nice.\\n\\nThe green tea ice cream was much creamier than I expected. To be honest, if I closed my eyes, I probably would have thought it was vanilla.\\n\\nOverall a 3.5 star experience. Food was okay, show was okay, service was exceptional! After tax and tip, it wasn\\'t too far from the face value. I don\\'t know where $140 came from, but I really wouldn\\'t have been able to justify that price. BAD EXPERIENCE TURNED GREAT! I had an interesting visit to this restaurant for my 30th birthday. I had gone with a large group of friends and was really looking forward to the Teppanyaki experience however there were a lot of short-comings the entire night. The service we received was poor. I wouldn\\'t say that it was really busy in the restaurant - perhaps 5 other tables at the time. The waiter was forgetting many items and the worst thing was that they gave my birthday cake that my friend had brought it for me to another table. They had also lost my friend\\'s umbrella which they had said they would keep at the front because it was wet from the rain. This was a bit let down that it ruined the whole night. \\n\\nThat being said - I had spoke to the manager over a period of weeks who promised to replace the umbrella and offered to have me back to dine again. 2 months after my first visit I returned with my boyfriend. And it is safe to say they absolutely redeemed themselves. The manager - Joey was very friendly and checked up on us to make sure our experience was good. We were even served by the same waiter who we had the first time. He was very professional, polite and apologized for our previous experience. The food itself was great! I had the Fillet mignon, lobster & scallops which was all cooked perfectly! The chef was quiet but did an excellent job of making sure we were well entertained. Definitely will return! This place is great for lunch during the week. It was pretty quiet but they still do the full on tepanyaki show. \\n\\nThe meal ended up being pretty affordable for what it was. The lunch special was a great deal. \\n\\nThe sake was good too. They mostly do warm sake they said but can make any of the sakes cold. The one we had was interesting because it was unfiltered. \\n\\nThe service was friendly. \\n\\nOverall, this spot is great value for a show and a meal, especially during lunch. It\\'s great that such a place is open for lunch. \\n\\nI haven\\'t tried it for dinner but I definitely recommend it for lunch! Had a great experience here at Hibachi. The food and service was good, the price is okay but it\\'s definitely worth it if you go every so often for that experience. The chefs put on a little cooking show and it\\'s nice to watch, I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and they had the cutest/funniest birthday package (couldn\\'t stop laughing). Overall it was a really nice experience. I had a good time with my mom eating here at the hibachi for dinner. The experience was great. Our chef\\'s name was Justin. I really enjoyed the part where he lit the onion on fire. He also tried to threw little pieces of broccoli into our mouths with his spatula. He succeeded the first two times and then it didn\\'t go so well for the rest of us but it was a good laugh. The food was actually really bland. The teriyaki sauce they used is extremely light and the dipping sauces they provided, which were a mayo-based and a ginger/soy sauce based,were also a bit plain. And I\\'m not a person that usually eat salty stuff. Portion is plenty though. Also, expect the steak to be over cooked because they were chopped into small pieces.\\n\\nThe Groupon was $75 for two plus tax and 15% service charge already added which ended up being $97.46. I don\\'t think it was a good deal because I think the deluxe combo which is $42 per person is somewhat similar but comes with filet mignon and salmon if I remember correctly. Groupon claims that this deal is originally $150 in value is very much an exaggerated overstatement. Overall was a good experience but I don\\'t think it\\'s worth a second visit. It\\'s maybe really a 3.5 star. Our group of eight were here on my birthday.  Excellent service provided by our host Shogu (spelt incorrectly), very friendly and accommodative to our requests for shifting us to a smaller table and making changes to the price fixed menu due to dietary requirements.  Ambiance was smart casual, and very modern.  Food was excellent and plentiful, cooked with some fanfare by the chef.  Scallops, shrimp, steak and chicken were cooked to perfection as requested by each couple, sauces provided for those who needed more flavor with their meat or seafood dishes.  A really nice place to come with a group due to the Teppanyaki style of cooking right at the table, although we had to speak loudly in order to get heard at the other end of the table.  When one of my friends mentioned to the host Shogu it was my birthday, we got a cheesecake slice with a candle on it, a group  picture was taken, printed and put on a card for the group to sign ... a very nice touch.  An extra star just for this neat little surprise.  I would recommend Hibachi at the Thompson and would definitely come back again. Came here with my boyfriend on a late Friday night as we had purchased a groupon ($75 for a 7 course meal for 2). The service was great, servers were overly friendly and accommating. We first got our miso soup (delicious! Not too salty and perfectly hot) then our house ginger salad (delicious as well). We then got a vegetable sushi roll which was so yummy, definitely one of the best rolls I\\'ve had and I wanted more. Next, the teppanyaki chef came and prepared our entrees! It was quite a fun show to watch especially the onion trick. He grilled some vegetables and vegetarian fried rice as our next meal. The vegetarian rice was ok, a bit too buttery tasting imo. The vegetables were yummy! For our main meal we had strip loin steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, shrimp, and Atlantic scallops. Yes, the groupon comes with all of these meats but not a full portion of each meat. It is extremely filling! I thought our steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the shrimp was wonderfully juicy. I could have cared less for the chicken and scallops though. Then finally, to finish it off we got a scoop of ice cream!\\n\\nOverall, my bf and I had a great time and really enjoyed our food and the entertainment. Would come here again but only on special occasions as it it on the pricier side (paid over $100 for the groupon with tax/tip and a couple beers) :) The service was friendly and engaging, but when it comes to the food, well mind I say the most overpriced and overrated I\\'ve ever encountered in Toronto? \\n\\nIt feels like you\\'ve walked into the 1990s where people crowd around teppanyaki as a form of exotic oriental performance, that said, the food is inevitably secondary to the performance they\\'ve put on. \\n\\nI truly do believe there is a lot of work, effort, and skill each and every chef invests in, but as a restaurant itself, I can\\'t bring myself to say I would ever come here again or pretend to like the lacklustre-uneventful taste of such a theatrical meal. \\n\\nYou\\'re paying $30+ for a performance, a seat at a orientalist facade. With all that being said, service was friendly, but the food comes before all decor or presentation We took my niece here for her 16th birthday.  Our cook was more on the quiet side.... did the standard show with the onion fire volcano, but no talking beyond \"how do you like your steak cooked?\" hence only 4 stars.  Over all the food tasted great and we had fun watching our food get cooked. Went there for a dinner with friends. The place itself is very beautiful and clean. The food was average. Nothing special. The Chef wasn\\'t enthusiastic at all. He came, cook everything in about 10 minutes and just left.  The salmon, shrimps and chicken meals were ok. Not much flavour. The gyoza appetizer and sushi appetizer were good. Just opened recently and was meaning to try it. Came here on a Friday and it was easy to get a table. There was actually a good amount of patrons and a huge restaurant but it seems like not many people know about this place yet. \\n\\n$10 cocktails, wide variety of choices. The two we had (mai tai and mango) may have lacked alcohol but its $10 and the flavour was good, as was the presentation.\\n\\nThe food was decently priced $17-40 for the teppanyaki. We got the salmon and also shrimp. They were delicious and the chef Yang was good. Some nice fire and a little spectacle but wasnt over the top. Also had a side of fried rice and it was good. \\n\\nOnly drawback is the cheesecake. It was too small. Don\\'t think I would order again.\\n\\nOverall, the sevice was top class, the food was great, and the drinks are cheap. It\\'s worth trying for sure especially if you live in the area. We went to HIBACHI for a work function and had a great time. Our party of 12 had a private room. Cocktails were made well, service was spot on.....friendly & personable server and teppanyaki chef. The chef put on quite the show while cooking.....impressive skills! The food was delicious! Great prices & decor. It was pretty quiet in the restaurant during lunch......I\\'m sure it\\'s much more lively in the evenings. There was only one thing that I liked about this place - a beautiful ornate gold mirror in the front room. Other than that, I completely disliked the experience. \\n\\nUpon arrival, the hostess greeted us and then proceeded to bash the owner while we waited for our table. She spoke poorly of him saying that \"he can\\'t figure anything out, he doesn\\'t know how to market the restaurant, he doesn\\'t know how to compete against the Thompson Dinner,  he\\'s been switching the hours of operation and closes too early, blah blah blah\". It was extremely awkward for us  (new patrons of the restaurant) to hear such criticism from a staff member. \\n\\nIt was a relief when we finally escaped the belligerent hostess and were seated at our table. The novelty of the atmosphere made me kind of giddy and I was excited to see the Teppanyaki Chef throwing knives amongst the flames at the neighbouring table. Unfortunately the euphoria wore off quickly once the food started to arrive. Our starters and sushi rolls promptly arrived at the same time the Teppanyaki Chef appeared to prepare our grilled dishes. We felt very rushed and asked the Server if the Chef could wait awhile to prepare the Teppanyaki so we could take the time to enjoy our starters and sushi rolls. She informed us that it wasn\\'t possible because he was going to prepare our dishes at the same time as the food for other 5 people at our table. Long story short, we were forced fed. Deplorable customer service.  See ya never Hibachi. I has been a while since we had visited a teppanyaki place and the first time for my kids.  It was a success.  The place is new and very nicely decorated. The staff were all superb - very friendly and helpful.  The cooks were skilled and the kids had a blast watching how he prepared the meal and handled the utensils. As we are not downtowners, it was still easy to get to and there is a parking lot just across the street so much appreciated as mom has a bad knee. My husband works downtown so just walked over. The food was cooked well and there was a good serving size.   Price was okay for the amount of food and entertainment any more and would be out of our pocket range. Decent, BUT most of teppanyaki I have been in the past, usually a combo of $35 would come with stirred veggie and scoop of ice cream, in that case kinda disappointed...3.5 solid My girlfriends and I went since we got a Groupon. Ambiance was nice and the food had a lot of variety. We got served veggies, rice, scallops, lobster, shrimp, steak, chicken, sushi, salad and soup. It was good value for your money on Groupon but I don\\'t know if I would come back here. The experience was great and the chef was talented but the service was poor from the host that welcomed us to the server who was absent from our section for 80% of our meal. We asked a host to take our picture and she refused and insisted that we call our waiter. I didn\\'t get it. I have to say that it looked like they were unstaffed tonight, however, our party\\'s plates were not cleared up for a good 15-20 mins despite other parties in our section had their plates cleared and their bill settled.  Overall, I would say do it once (with the Groupon) for the experience and hope to get better service than what we got tonight. I came here with a handful of friends & we had a great time! I had low expectations seeing as how dead it was (and continues to be) anytime I walk by there. But the food was awesome and the chef was entertaining. There\\'s a bartender that\\'s a little abrupt/rude, but the rest of the staff is on point & friendly. \\n\\nI really wish they would spruce up the outside and get rid of the pub-like \"$5 beer\" banners because it definitely cheapens the atmosphere of the restaurant. Also, the banners are a little misleading since it\\'s quite expensive to actually EAT there so I can\\'t imagine anyone stopping for a cheap beer and also buying food when they can go across the street to an actual pub. Just came back from dinner with my wife.  We used an expired Groupon deal which means they give you a full credit of the deal or honour the original deal.  Prior to ordering we confirmed this policy with the hostess and server. When it came time to pay for the bill the owner came over and told us we had to pay an additional 15 dollars.  Nominal amount but it\\'s the principal.  Food was ok but please don\\'t try to pull a fast one. Amazing new tepanyaki place, great service, quality food and a decent chef with skills on knives. Definitely worth a shot. Oh and $4 pints! I found it interesting that I made reservations the night before just in case that it would be busy during lunch time (at 1pm), but when we arrived, there was only one other couple eating. Anyways, the interior is decorated for what feels like more nighttime dinner experiences. In the daylight, it felt empty, but our server was kind and ensured we were comfortable. We came for the lunch menu, which I think is a fair price (~$30 for two of us incl. tax) considering the food options and the chef\\'s show. First we were served the miso soup, followed by the salad, both alright. It felt awkward that we were the only ones there by the time the chef arrived, however we were still happy to see him do his work and see our food cooked at the same time. The portions of salmon and striploin steak were just right, including the veggies. We did not opt for any upgrades or additional menu items. Would recommend for the experience. Exceeded expectations! The service was FANTASTIC which makes a world of difference. The chef and entertainment level was great, the food was WOW. Nothing bad I could say :)'],\n",

       "  'Markham station of 2017 is not the markham station of the past. Now only have they revamped their interior they have done wonders to the menu. Much cleaner and tidied  interior with brand new fresh booths and a menu that\\'s much more updated .\\n\\nWe went Saturday evening for the breakfast and it was delicious. Everything was fresh and made to order and the service was awesome. Highly suggest for a quick bite to eat or if your craving breakfast foods! Pros:\\n- huge portion sizes\\n- relatively cheap food\\n- 24 hour service\\n- the wait staff are all very personable and friendly\\n- relaxed atmosphere\\n\\ncons:\\n- dirty place in general\\n- greasy (though some people may find that a pro)\\n\\nOverall, I\\'ve gone here a few times and it\\'s great for a late night binge with friends. I\\'ve never visited during their busy hours, and I\\'ve typically gotten their breakfast or fish and chips. The coffee is hit and miss, but if you can get a fresh pot it\\'s quite good. I\\'ll definitely go back when I\\'ve got a late night craving for greasy food! Okay, this is not some fine, dinning establishment. This is a diner. Not only that, but apparently it\\'s a 24 hour diner, so that\\'s pretty frigging awesome. Good to know. Those come in handy.\\n\\nAs a diner, it\\'s food was perfectly acceptable and actually very good. The service was excellent! Prices were decent. I don\\'t know what else you need!\\n\\nI came for lunch with a ground of friends. We wanted drinks, we wanted food, some wanted breakfast food (they have all day breakfast...also awesome) and this fit the bill perfectly. \\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet and accommodating and fast with the food and drinks. She split up all our bills for us, with no problem (so many places it\\'s like the biggest deal ever). \\n\\nEveryone enjoyed their food and we certainly got a variety of it. All large portions. Drinks were good, so no complaints there! \\n\\nThe atmosphere is...well let\\'s call it quaint. It has some dated decor and paintings on the wall of a sort of olden-days train station. It\\'s a diner, so it is what it is!\\n\\nOnly criticism of this place is that it only takes cash. They have an ATM in the front, but be prepared. \\n\\nOtherwise, I would totally come back to this place! They made one mean grilled cheese! Markham Station is a throwback to the good old days when you could get a plate of artery clogging goodness for less than $10. Surprisingly, not much has changed here. If you get in early enough, you get their $5.99 deal which includes 3 eggs, bacon, and potato\\'s, along with anything else they have in their kitchen thrown in for good measure.\\n\\nApart from the usual breakfast foods of eggs, pancakes, french toast and omelettes, there\\'s also a good number of more \\'lunch driven\\' options like burgers and sandwiches. The club sandwich is particularly good. It\\'s big, well put together and even comes with a pickle (yay).\\n\\nIf you\\'re in the mood for a traditional breakfast and looking for a Cora\\'s alternative, then I would give this place a try. Just get ready to waddle home with a belly full of satisfaction. Came here for a very late dinner in the early mornings around 1am. The food quality is average but for the price you pay, it\\'s quite a good deal. What is great about this restaurant is the service of the waitresses. Everyone is very friendly and makes the meal that much better. Been to Markham station multiple times before and after the renovation. Always end up going at the most oddest hours. \\n\\nThe recent renovations are pretty nice, good face lit for the restaurant overall.\\n\\nFor a place that operates 24/7, you gotta give them some slack. You cant be expecting top notch food. Been going for years, the foods been good and for the most part consistent. Home style taste but is a bit bland. Personally I try to gear towards the non breakfast stuff, like Greek diners, sandwiches, chicken mains, etc. \\n\\nRecently went with some friends, forgot the menu item name but got some sunny side eggs, chicken breast, and fries. They got the regular breakfast items. everything was cooked well. The food tasted as you would expect. Grilled chicken breast tasted like it was seasoned with just salt and pepper. \\n\\nBut doesn\\'t bother me cause its 6am, been awake for almost 20hrs, everything\\'s closed, there\\'s dew on parked cars, McDonalds is switching their menu so they wont serve, the city\\'s waking up and I am eating something that\\'s fresh and doesn\\'t taste entirely like cardboard. For me that good enough. Good food that\\'s always available.\\n\\nOverall 4/5. Only negative would be the inconsistent service. Horrible food but they are open 24hours.\\nI\\'d love to say nicer things about this place because it\\'s just down the street from my house, but they really have gotten lazy over the years. \\nUsed to be good fresh made food, but now everything is premade and not worth eating. \\nI suppose it is nice to put in your order and have it in 5 minutes, but the trade off is it was likely made the day before and just tossed on the grill to warm. \\n\\nBecause it is open all night they are busy when the bars close, but drunk people are not very picky. \\nAnyways, about all I would recommend here is a coffee if you are up late, good luck getting a refill though, the staff don\\'t pay much attention. Worst rude service ....Disgusting foods....salty left over heated burned creamy chicken soup .... Nasty undercook sausages....gross!!! This is a well known restaurant because it\\'s one of the few places that is open 24hrs in scarborough. This place is only good for hangovers or an after club destination! One of the only true \"diners\" left in the east end. Great food, good family pricing and the staff is always friendly. Hard to find that combination nowadays. Prices are very reasonable, and the size and quality of the food is great . Very family friendly and you can\\'t beat the early bird breakfast special. Food was amazing and the service was friendly and quick! The new renovations are beautiful, we had a very good experience here and will be back again soon! Worst place for breakfest nothing special and really really expensive. \\nEverything is generic and the own is this greek or italian guy with a pony tail whos really really rude and doesnt care about his customers. \\nI had the burger once, it was one of those frozen burgers u can find at any store for 25cents a peice. It had a dry bun and old veggies that have been sitting around for a while. \\nThis place is loaded with gangster wanna bees and thugs STAY AWAY!!!!!!! This was my first time at Markham Station and I don\\'t think it\\'ll be my last.\\n\\nMy group of 8 and I came here at around 2am and seating was no problem at all. There are lots of large areas where all 8 of us could sit comfortably and on the same table. \\n\\nBeing 24h definitely makes this spot a great option for late night owl and sometimes just because there\\'s nothing else open. We had a very friendly waitress that was fairly attentive, no complaints on the service. The location was apparently renovated and it seemed like they did a good job. Decor was very nice and modern.\\n\\nWe made the mistake of grabbing McDonalds before hand because we weren\\'t sure if we were coming here or not, and boy was that a mistake. Almost all of us ordered \"The Super\" which is available all day and comes with 3 pancakes, 3 sausages, 3 strips of bacon and 3 eggs along with home fries. \\n\\nThe bacon was extremely crispy, sausages were nice and juicy, pancakes and eggs  were not bad, and the home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Really no complaints about this meal and none of us were able to finish. The best part is that the entire meal is only 12.99! \\n\\nAs this being my first time here, I\\'m going to make sure I come on an empty stomach the next time! 4/5 Been going for years and their breakfast is so good and great price.  Love their dinners as well try their souvlaki dinner had that many times.\\nJUST A GREAT RESTURANT REASONBILE PRICES AND GOOD HOME COOKING. Went here for a midnight fix of all-day-breakfast. The food was just alright, but nothing great. My girlfriend had found not only one strand of hair on her plate while munching, but two! As anyone would expect, she lost her appetite right after. wow this place is a dump, I was dragged here twice...\\n\\nonce for breakfast only. We came after 11pm, so it was the all-day breakfast price, which was pretty high for a couple of eggs, sausage and fries. It was blah, it was plain old breakfast, what did I expect? the waitress kept forgetting my drink order... Just a cup of OJ please? didn\\'t come till I almost finished my breakfast. nothing special to note, but it wasn\\'t horrible.\\n\\nSo I came back again for dinner (let\\'s just say I will never EVER come back here again) I don\\'t understand why there is so many elderly people dining here when the food is so HARD, GREASY and UNHEALTHY.\\n\\nMy friend said he saw a $16.99 T-bone steak special and wanted to come and try... OK, except we came on a Saturday and it\\'s not on special, so he ordered it anyways for $22.99 ($6 more) I order a half rack of ribs (I have no idea why, since it\\'s NOT a smoke house or anything?)\\n\\nthe meals came with salad or soup and a couple of garlic toast.\\n\\nThe Caesar salad was overly dressed, and the house salad was plain to the max (with your choice of dressing)\\n\\nThe ribs came and it was HARD as a rock! I ate one rib, and my friend tried one and that was it. The home style potatoes was I guess? I\\'ve had better ribs from swiss chalet (and I\\'m not a fan of this place either)\\n\\nThe T-Bone steak was such bad quality I\\'m not sure if it is SAFE to eat medium-rare? My friend finished it anyways since he was hungry.\\n\\nLet\\'s just say he had bad news when he talked to me the next day (something like going to the washroom in the middle of the night) and he is usually able to take anything.\\n\\nThis place is dirty and food is gross. The worst place I\\'ve ever been to. To start, a busser splashed dirty water at my friend and I. They apologized so we let it go. But they didn\\'t even give us napkins after we got wet.\\n\\nWhen they sat us at the table, there were crumbles all over the seats and oil stains everywhere. I had to go to the washroom and get toilet paper and soap to clean it myself.\\n\\nOur server was nothing special. She did not smile. She got us refills but she has not really present. We tried to ask other servers for service to order or napkins only to get yelled at. One server said in an angry tone that they are very busy and to go ask someone else because there are different sections.\\n\\nThis restaurant has below average food. The servers are terrible and don\\'t smile. There is no sense of teamwork what so ever. Every server is for themselves here. They do not prioritize the guest\\'s needs. Rather they put themselves first.\\n\\nI have worked in a restaurant for 5 years. I noticed that the servers had a 5-6 table section on labour day. They do not walk that fast. They do not have full hands in and out of the kitchen. I will not be coming back here. This server even yelled at my friend and said she does not understand how the restaurant works. \\n\\nA tip: bring a raincoat because they will splash dirty water at you. This is my go to place from 3-5am if i don\\'t want fast food or chinese.\\n\\nusually i\\'ll order the pork souvlaki dinner. its a pretty big serving so i know im not leaving hungry.\\n\\nomelettes are great too.\\n\\nservers are very kind and friendly. it\\'s usually not busy when i go, so service is pretty prompt.\\n\\nthis place has been around for years and years and years, and it shows. a renovation may do wonders for them. Terrible service!\\n\\nI would give this place a negative if Yelp would let me!\\n\\nWe waited more than 30 mins for our food and they serves us with the wrong order.  We asked about our order since it was wrong  and the waiter said \"it\\'s okay, the chef does what he wants.\" \\nIn addition, we were in the middle of eating our food and our waiter rushed to clean up our table. \\n\\nHe was extremely rude and didn\\'t even let us enjoy the wrong order of food. \\n\\nNever coming to this place ever again! If only there was a way to rate this restaurant as zero stars. My friend and I were ignored at the door by a server writing \\'no separate bills, no debit\\' on a blackboard. We were seated only to be ignored by our server who was rude. We went in there hungry and ready to eat and after seeing that I couldn\\'t order what I wanted (a grilled chicken salad) we finally called it quits and walked out. This was the third strike Markham Station. I won\\'t be going back. Food here is always a hit or miss. The food is never good, but could be really satisfying. Very family style cooking, like mama\\'s cooking. They offer a very warm, friendly atmosphere, like how it would be like to go home to a small town. They make you feel right at home. Prices are fair. A real 24 hours restaurant and bar in Scarborough.\\nLarge very spacious, all day breakfast and a large menu with varieties.\\n\\nBeen there many times (those late bites).\\n\\nA+ Great staff, very friendly and quick service.\\n\\nFood it\\'s not the greatest but can\\'t complain it\\'s cheap and portions are huge. What can I say.. It\\'s Markham Station. I don\\'t come here for a fancy meal or attentive service, I come here for a cheap breakfast once in a while.\\n\\nIt is typically as expected; alright, nothing fancy. Bang for your buck. Love coming here for fulfill my breakfast craving! Came here on Family day and there was seating room. Our server was friendly and pleasant. So with it to come here for lunch. The pork souvlaki was filling and delicious. Breakfast is always good good for parents with children. The booths can fit the car seat!! Always come here whenever we are in this side of town. I am a bit disappointed in my most recent trip to Markham Station. It was around 7:30pm on a weekend night, lots of empty seats. We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks which were really good and I would get those again. However, I ordered the Steak Sandwich which was just a strip of \"steak\" stuck in-between 2 slices of italian bread with lettuce and tomato on the side. HP sauce couldn\\'t fix the bland taste of that steak. My friend ordered the Pork Souvlaki, although they give you a lot of food for the $15, it was not worth it. \\n\\nWe didn\\'t finish some of our food because of the quantity and the (lack of) taste and the waitress asked us why. Really? \\n\\nI would still come back here because it\\'s convenient and just for breakfast, but I will still ignore the staffs\\' nosey comments. I thought about giving this place 1 star but because their breakfast is pretty good I gave it 2. A lot of people are complaining about the food and I\\'m surprised more ppl are not complaining about the service. There\\'s one server there who sits and chats with customers and she doesn\\'t come around to see how anything is, you literally have to go up to her and ask for whatever you need. And when you want your receipt none of them are anywhere in sight. \\n\\nIf you have a lot of time to wait for refills your bill etc then this is a good place to go, if you wanna be in and out this is not a good place. Sometimes you just crave greasy diner food, coupled with rude service in the dead of the night, surrounded by questionable clientele. Markham Station has it all. Too expensive for what it is though.\\n\\nPS - they charge $1.50 for hot water. Sketchy move If you like to get heart attack from eating breakfast. This is the place to go.\\n\\nIt use to be good like 15 years ago. Now this is just a hole. \\n\\nEven they say breakfast special $3.99 you bill will usually come up to 10 bucks per person. \\n\\nThe whole place smell like you are in the kitchen. After you finish your meal you will want to go home and change. Unless you like walk around smelling like breakfast. \\n\\n:-) Great fish and chips. The servers are nice except for the one guy. Very greasy food so don\\'t expect to leave feeling healthy, but you will feel full! This is one of two 24 hour restaurants that I know in the area are open. Such a convent place to go if you get hungry during the night. Accessible by ttc or car. Food is good , they have two sides to this restaurant. One side is the bar and the second side is the sit in restaurant. The bar side has tvs. This location has just recently been updated it looks really nice. Service is usually good. And food is usually quick. Their menu has a wide variety of foods to choose from for decent prices. Terrible service overall need to train there staff in customer service the food is not that great Extremely bad food.    The black lady waitress gave us an attitude when I pointed out her bad service this very early morning.   I talked to her why we were not happy with her service politely and calmly, but she talked me back without apology.  She also raised her voice toward us.  As an excuse, she said to us her shift was over long time ago, but she had to be there for her co-worker.    So what?     I did not give her tips after all this conversation.   She behaved worse after. This place has seriously gone downhill.\\n\\nI used to come here often, seeing as how it was 24 hours and a good price for all day breakfast. \\n\\nThe food has gone south. Had the steak and eggs for $13.99 and it was disgusting. I could go to T-Bonez and get an 8oz steak dinner for $13.99. The eggs were really dry. The steak was really dry. Everything was really dry.\\n\\nOur meals came with toast, and no jam! We were told we had to pay 20 cents per pod of jam. Hello? I think that if you\\'re going to serve toast, the least you can do it provide you one pod of jam. Then charge extra for additional.\\n\\nThe service was bleh too, I mean I guess you sort of expect it from a place like this. But our server asked only one person if they wanted white or brown toast. And then asked another person if they wanted home fries or something else. Aren\\'t you supposed to ask everyone?\\n\\nBad experience. Won\\'t come back. Atmosphere: Big restaurant, lacks warmth, needs a major facelift\\n\\nFood: \\n1. breakfast speciall. 1/5 , 4.99 special, makes me wish i spent it on Tim Hortons instead. Bread was so buttery that it was no longer toasted, sausages were dry. Display of the food was so unappealing. \\n\\nOveral: we found food still stuck on the utensils, will most definitely not be back Came here for an early breakfast. This was by far the fastest breakfast i ever ordered, no exaggeration it was ready 4 minutes after I ordered. The eggs were poached perfectly. The hash browns were a bit bland, they could use some seasoning. Overall great experience and fast service Okay, let\\'s be clear here. We\\'re talking about a 24 hour breakfast restaurant that happens to sell other items cleverly disguised to be viable options at lunch and dinner.\\n\\nIf you\\'re on your cell phone and you\\'re looking for a plateful of food and just need to get your grub on then you\\'ve found your mecca. Any of the breakfast menu items found on one side of the paper placemat menu will do. All you have to decide is how much cholesterol you\\'re in the mood for.\\n\\nServers are pretty quick here and when it\\'s busy there\\'s a reason for that - they want to get you in an out as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThe decor has all the charm of the lower deck on the Titanic. I always laugh at the barrier between booths that are side by side. This piece of wood that is elbow height can be removed to make the booths feel more like one unit. Someone put time and effort into this but it really doesn\\'t improve any scenario when removed.\\n\\nTO SUM IT UP: Come here and get breakfast any time of the day but don\\'t be dissuaded of the book by its cover. This is a great place for breakfast and late night eats. I always enjoy the super breakfast..enough food to last me till dinner! Granted it isn\\'t the fanciest of places, it still gets the job done.\\nWouldn\\'t recommend non-breakfast options however.\\nPrice is also very reasonable and staff are generally quite friendly. Weekends are absolutely jam packed so be read to wait. Horrible service.  Arrived as a group - called days ahead - and they would not accommodate individual billing and were not staffed for a large group.  For a place that advertises fast service it took nearly 90 minutes for our group to get served.  Too 45min for drinks alone.   Multiple people cancelled orders and left because we had younger children in our group who after 90 minutes of waiting the time of day had become too late for them.  I had ordered the western sandwich and a milkshake.  The food was sub par, bland, and mostly uninteresting.   One of my fellow diners had a fly in their salad and another took 2 hours to get a glass of coke.\\n\\nService was rude and indignant from the one server who handled a group of 40.  She consistently complained about too many people and not having her coffee yet.  I\\'m not sure how this is the diner\\'s problem.  Even after getting our food it took 30 or more minutes to get bills.  Even after all this she automatically added 10% tip to the bills.\\n\\nTL;DR = Don\\'t go here. Bad food, bad service. Legitimately the worst restaurant experience I\\'ve ever had. I think my reaction to this place is \"Meh\", but I come back whenever I\\'m in the area because I like breakfast food.\\n\\nStaff: It was easy to get a seat, and they took our order quickly but then for the most of the time we did not see our waitress, so getting the bill took some time. But they were not busy at all, in fact the wait staff was chatting with each other most of the time.\\n\\nAmbience: It felt dirty. The spoon I had was unclean, as if it was licked clean, rather than washed clean. The seats were sticky, and the place definitely looked like it could use some sprucing up. It doesn\\'t have that nostalgic or home-like feel, so it just felt drabby.\\n\\nFood: It was alright. I had ordered their lunch special where you get toast, eggs, sausage or bacon, and home fries. I wanted over-medium eggs but they came as over-well. I opted for sausage which were nice. They only had strawberry jam to go with your toast, which was disappointing. Overall it was nothing too memorable but I was full by the end of the meal. Also, apparently hot water is like $1+, which I didn\\'t see in the menu so it was my fault. I do think that it could\\'ve been free though.\\n\\nIt\\'s alright, but I wouldn\\'t seek it out. After a long night of partying, our group was tired and famished. Desperate for food, we luckily spotted Markham Station. All we wanted was something cheap and filling; this establishment filled that void in our stomachs. Markham Station had a very expansive menu including an all day breakfast menu. The food was plentiful but cheap, in which was reflected in quality. I ordered the well-done steak which was great, the eggs okay, but the fries were horrible. The interior likewise reflected the pricing of the menu; bland, few colours, but lots of windows. Service was slow and not very friendly. The crowd too seemed a bit sketchy but that maybe because we went at 2am. All and all, this place is like a downgraded Golden Grill. Open 24 hours, cheap but expansive menu with deplorable service and atmosphere. Dine here only if you are desperate for a filling meal at 2am! The super breakfast is always good. But last time I wanted something different and tried the quiche. Big mistake. Small portion and overcooked to the point that the crust was rock hard. Would go back but only for the breakfast specials. About the only thing it has going for it is that it\\'s open 24-hours which is a rarity in that part of the city. The menu is extensive, but I get the impression that the reason they\\'re able to do this is that a lot of things are frozen. The breakfast food is better than the rest of the menu I find. If you\\'re hungry, it\\'s late, you don\\'t feel like asian food or driving to a better option downtown (like 7 West or Fran\\'s) then it\\'ll do. Came here on a Sunday morning - wasn\\'t that busy. Was a little skeptical about the place when I first approached it and saw the exterior - but it was evident that they did upgrades on the interior. \\n\\nFiance and I ordered the Super Breakfast (3 eggs, 3 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausages, home fries) and the Breakfast Special (3 eggs, 3 sausages, home fries and toast). \\n\\nWe usually go to Sunset Grill for breakfast on weekends - but we changed it up and came here. It wasn\\'t that bad.. food came out really fast, the eggs were cooked perfectly. However, the pancakes were a little too dense, I like my pancakes fluffy. As for the sausages, it was a little too salty and too overcooked. Bacon was cooked well - not too crispy.\\n\\nWould most likely come back again in the future. I went to this restaurant for brunch for the first time. From the outside, it seems a good choice\\n However, when I got the order, it tuns out a wrong wrong wrong choice! The food tasted terrible! Eggs tasted like plastic, no mention about the fronze bacon and werid home made potota. I stop eating and left 99% of the food on my plate. What wrose was the bad customer service, or no customer service. I end up left the restaurant and no tip. Yes, the terrible food + bad customer service, do not worth a penny of any tip. Never never go there. Someone recommended this all day breakfast restaurant so I\\'ve decided to go and check it out. The service was awful. The waitress treated me as if I wasn\\'t there. I\\'ve ordered a soup and breakfast but my soup never showed up and they served with wrong food. At the end, one of the complementary candies was missing. I will not go back. The quality of this place has been going down hill over the years. Its just a cheap place to get a 4.99 breakfast from 6am-11am. Nothing more nothing less.\\n\\nThey do not have debit machines. This place is cheap and dirty. \\n\\nMy work comes here for breakfast 3 times a year and the place always leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. I don\\'t think it\\'s food poisoning but a normal person cannot handle that much grease. After learning my lesson a couple times with their traditional breakfast or omlette, I have switched my order to a bagel and fruit bowl which is only mildly better. I usually find a few pieces of over ripe fruit in the mix.\\n\\nThis place is somewhere I\\'d never choose to go on my own, but if all you\\'re looking for is the absolute cheapest option, you may have found your place because the portions in the breakfasts are a decent size.\\n\\nAnyway, my recommendation would be to skip this place unless you love your grease served with a little egg and bacon. YUCK! Key Features: Banquet Burger, and the Paintings on the wall.\\n\\nI\\'ve been coming back to Markham Station for the better part of a decade.  Why?  Originally, it was because - when I needed a full belly at three o\\'clock in the morning, this was the only game in town.  Well, there was Golden Griddle - but Markham Station was a cut above.\\n\\n24 hour dining has never looked so good.  To this day, I\\'ve only been in about 3 or 4 times before 11pm.  My normal Markham Station experience takes place between 2 - 4am.\\n\\nThe staff are great, and seem happy to be there.  Which I\\'ve never understood, as they\\'re working at 3 in the morning.  But this is a big plus that not all 24 hour diners will offer.\\n\\nNext up is the banquet burger.  Throw down some bacon, a moist, juicy, patty, and all the veggies you could want - and you\\'re set.  But then you end up with more fries than you\\'d see as a separate order in any number of other establishments.  And then they give you a vat of mayonnaise.  If, for some reason, there\\'s not enough mayo, they\\'ll keep hooking you up - free of charge.\\n\\nNow, the food - and the timing - that\\'s just one small reason to show up to Markham Station.  The other is the large painting on the far wall.  The first time you see it, you\\'ll just assume it\\'s a train, pulling into the station.  Then you start to notice details.  First, little ones (like the giant goose standing on the horizon) then another - some of the people don\\'t have shadows.  The only explanation?  Ghosts.  In the house on the far right - often unseen due to it being blocked by the barricade to the washroom - there is a ghostly black face in the darkened window.\\n\\nLittle by little the horror in this serene scene beings to grow.  And then you notice there are other paintings on other walls.  The more you notice, the more bizarre it all seems.  But then you forget.  And you\\'re back to the burger.\\n\\nOhh yeah - and if you get garlic bread with your meal?  Eat it first.  Otherwise it will cut apart the inside of your mouth, once it has hardened, at the end of your meal. I love breakfast and I do value good breakfast for a reasonable price. I like how big this place is and lots of room to sit down. But I didn\\'t like the long wait time and also how late the staff were to serve me. The food quality was better than average but I have still had better ones. Overall an ok place to eat. Worth trying it Basic place.\\nGood food.\\nGood service.\\n\\nThey charge for a cup of hot water here because people ask for hot water and bring their own tea bags. What do you expect in Scarborough anyways? Ghetto\\n\\nDisgusting washroom on a late Monday morning....and that was the womens washroom.  Looks like it wasnt cleaned in 2 days.  Had to tell the staff to go give it some attention. Not sure what\\'s happened to this spot but the quality of the food has gone way down. Just left with my meal half eaten bc it was pretty much inedible. After ordering out meals, my gf and I were shocked at how fast our meals arrived, but were disgusted when everything we bit into was cold.. After getting the servers attention, she was kind enough to take them back and and again she was out quickly with our \"new orders\".  These new meals were definitely hot, but the problem was there were the exact same meals we had sent back. The salt and pepper we had added were still there and nothing had moved... \\n\\nWhat kind of restaurant serves their customers cold eggs and then just reheats the dishes.. It\\'s bad enough the food had been obviously sitting for a while, but then to just try to pass it off as new meals is ridiculous.  Needless to say that was my last visit to Markham Station They are open 24 hours in Scarborough. What more do you want? lol You can\\'t come here with super high expectations. \\n\\nTheir all day breakfast is great however it is pretty greasy compared to other breakfast joints. They also serve different foods like souvlaki dinners, salads, sandwiches, ribs, roasted chicken and etc.  I\\'ve only ever had their breakfast foods and chicken souvlaki dinner. Their portions are pretty big, you will not leave feeling hungry if you actually eat your food. \\n\\nService here is pretty quick and they always have CP24 on. So catch up on your daily news and weather while munching away at some food that quick! When you have a table next to the bussing station, please be considerate and do not slam the dishes when you\\'re putting them away. All the clanging made it hard for me to hear and eventually gave me a headache. In addition, there was a questionable spill on the floor of my booth as well as my seat. \\n\\nThe food was alright. Typical breakfast for a decent price. I normally like these kinds of places, but this place disappointed me.\\n\\nHad the station fries cheese (fries with monterey jack cheese, plus a small container of gravy). The melted cheese was already cold by the time we got it. The gravy they gave us was far too small. There was nothing special about the fries. I don\\'t think this dish was worth the money. Reviewing the menu now, I didn\\'t even know it was supposed to have bacon!\\n\\nMy main was a light caesar burger. The burger patty was slightly burnt. The caesar dressing was watery and had little taste. The burger came with lots of toppings including lettuce, pickle and tomatoes. The burger bun was cold. Overall, also a disappointment.\\n\\nThe food also took a while to come out. At least service was friendly.\\n\\nI\\'d only come back again if I was hungry and it was the middle of the night and everything else was closed. Actually, maybe not - I\\'d just go to McDonald\\'s. If you get here before 11am, breakfast here is super cheap and delicious (you really cannot go wrong with breakfast food anyway). Generally, I drop by here when Cora\\'s is too crowded, because there\\'s so much more seating here.\\nHowever, the reason I only gave this restaurant a 3 out of 5 is because, in my experience, service here is really hit or miss. One day I\\'ll get an amazing server that\\'s kind and friendly, and the next day I\\'ll be waiting for 10 minutes to be seated (when the restaurant is practically empty). Otherwise, they have a solid all day breakfast menu and after renovations, a nice and bright interior. Will probably come again for an early breakfast. Markham station is a classic breakfast place.  It\\'s kid friendly with activities and crayons.  The breakfast is good, however my complaint is that they need more variety with their pancakes - for example, chocolate chip pancakes, or blueberry pancakes.\\n\\nFriendly service staff. My family and I shared a breakfast wrap with home fries ($8.99) and a Greek salad which came with garlic bread ($10?). The wrap was pretty good but basic, it had eggs, bacon, shredded cheese. There were plenty of Homefries which were good as well, not too oily, I believe they were baked not fried. The Greek salad was a large portion and the dressing was very fresh tasting. The coffee was better than I thought it would be, $2.50 I think with free refills. \\nThe service was quick and friendly (came at around 3pm weekday though), decor was modern, tables and washrooms were clean. The food is great and affordable but the servers are so rude. I would enjoy eating at this place more If i got better service. This place is horrible the little Indian man at the cashier has no type of customer service skills he ignores you and gives you attitude once you\\'ve paid lol they show a regular size McDonald\\'s cup drink in the picture and give you a small Dixie cup once you\\'ve cashed out we didn\\'t even want the combo!! talk about bamboozled . My man liked the burger but I think it all looked shit every time I ate a French frie I got sadder sadder . The gravey was disgusting as well and was like salty sorta tasted like curry yuck ....this place should be scheduled for demolition cause I give it a -0 The only good thing about this place is the music and memories I\\'ve had here. This used to be the only breakfast restaurant I knew of that was open 24 hours until I came along a more affordable, better-tasting one called Honey B Hive. \\n\\nOnly come to Markham Station if you have a lot of time to waste. The food takes forever and the staff are not attentive at all. Even getting a table takes long when it is not busy. The food is a bit overpriced but it is not bad. \\n\\nThe only thing that ticked me off the last time I came here was this one waitress who had no adequate manners whatsoever and just reached for my baby, touching her face and who knows where else before we could even say anything. Mind you, she has quite intense allergies that the waitress could have easily had contact to. When we said something the second time she did it, she didn\\'t apologize and just stomped off. By the way, we asked to switch waiters but they told us it\\'s by section so we just let it go and ate quickly so we could leave. \\n\\nIt is extremely rude to touch someone without their permission especially if that person doesn\\'t have a voice of their own yet and obviously would not like strangers touching them in any way just as we would not enjoy strangers touching us. Markham Station is unprofessional in general (their other waiters aren\\'t much better - they are usually talking loudly amongst themselves instead of noticing customers calling for their attention), but after this experience, I don\\'t think I will ever come back. Actually isn\\'t that bad, you can get a very decent breakfast even when you are a criminal on the run as the place looks to be full the then after hours.  Thats just a joke but the whole plaza if full of Scarborough stereotypes which in small doses can be kind of fun.  Check this place out if you have never been. Expensive ! Just don\\'t buy any overly priced drinks. Below average service. Unless they change, no second time. Always good food. Standard fare. Quick service. Ask for Natasha, she\\'s the sweetest lady to serve you. \\n\\nThey have brekky specials so take advantage! \\n\\n24h service! I truly believe that Markham Station is a Scarborough gem. Most of the people I\\'ve met who are from Scarborough has heard of Markham Station. Food truly brings people together\\n\\nI went by again not too long ago and was really surprised at the change of decor! They have renovated their interior to a more classy modern feel compared to their previous decor which gave the impression of an old-school diner. But I really really like the new decor and am happy this place is upgrading because I would be sad if Markham Station ever closes down.\\n\\nBefore 10 or 11AM, they have a $6 breakfast special that always fills me up and leaves me satisfied. It comes with the same ol\\' breakfast deal anywhere - 3 eggs, choice of sausage, ham or bacon, with home fries (you can switch this I believe) and choice of toast.\\n\\nService was good, she was attentive to our water and asked us if the food and everything was alright. I do really like the homefries here, probably 2nd to Panagio\\'s. The booths were really comfy and I like how everything seems sparkly and new.\\n\\nAt Markham Station, there is also a take-out area which you can go in, order and there are a few seats available for you to eat your takeout in there as well. The take-out area has a seperate entrance from the dining area. They also have a bar area which closes around 1-2AM, I believe.\\n\\nMarkham Station is also 24 hours, so sometimes I\\'ll come by for a late night snack... heehee. For those who haven\\'t been to Markham Station, I really recommend that you do! So, if you\\'re from Scarborough, you know about Markham Station. The location has done a number of upgrades with their decor and their food. \\n\\nThe decor makes the place look much more modern. It was apparently done in August 2016 (this year) so it looks all clean and nice. The staff is usually as friendly unless you get them during the club rush at 3am.\\n\\nThe food looks like it was upgraded in certain areas as well. My friend got the Steak and Eggs, and it looked good. The Fish and Chips I had looked like a step up as well. HOWEVER, it tasted similar to how it has been for years. Its decent, and can hit the spot when you\\'re hungry (its 24 hours). But not a place to go out of your way for. \\n\\nI give it an A-OK since I have been going here for many many years. It is infamous in Scarboruogh for the years of fights that used to occur there. We can all tell stories about this place. Cops would always be there eating/coffee as a deterrent. Upgrades may be good, but it is to soon to determine it it should rank higher. But it is a staple of the east end, especially if you grew up on these streets. OK not fine dining, on my first visit ...food was tasty & service was quick.  The waitress on in the afternoon was very considerate & helped us  to pick from the huge menu and in accommodating food allergies. Horrible food. Horrible service. Two thumbs down. Will never go here again.\\n\\nThe food was greasy, bland, and disgusting. How do they screw up eggs and toast? The waitress was extremely rude. She told us to hurry up and leave because her shift was ending. When I brought my complaint to the manager, he didn\\'t care and was outright rude. If that\\'s how they think they\\'ll keep customers then keep it up.\\n\\nI will never go to this place again and I tell everyone I know to stay away. I hope they go out of business so that others won\\'t have to be subjected to their garbage food and garbage attitude. They don\\'t even deserve one star but there\\'s no option for zero. This place is amazing after its renovations! Service is nice and friendly and the food seemed to have improved a lot after it being renovated it\\'s no more greasy but they have options between roasted potatoes, rice, and regular fries with every breakfast special. I\\'ve been coming here regularly after it\\'s renovations! Keep up the good work! Sitting down with food in front of me in under 10 mins!!!\\n\\nAnd that\\'s where it ends...I needed a quick breakfast and was in the area so I stopped in.  It\\'s nothing special; I can make this at home.  It was quick & cheap & not McDonalds. Me and my bf came here on a Sunday evening. Ordered souvlaki and baby back ribs. My souvlaki was tasty with a lot of rice and salad on the side. However bf said his ribs were kinda dry.\\n\\nService was good. Our server was friendly. I did notice it took a long time for her to take the order for the couple sitting next to us. She was apologetic though.  \\n\\nDecent diner food. I may come back when I am around but probably won\\'t go out of my way to eat here. Came here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast... 2nd time around and i have to say i should have paid the extra money and went to coras. \\n\\nI got the western omelette and it was dry, their hash brown was dry. Its a sad meal when ketchup cant even save the meal. 20cents for jam... I couldn\\'t even enjoy jam on my white toast that i didn\\'t get asked whether i wanted white or brown. \\n\\nOh yes and i felt bad for my friend as i started to realize that the server instead of asking for help stacked my plate on top of hers. So i got some steak sauce on the side of my plate. \\n\\nNot a place ill be coming back again. I really like this place!\\n\\nI have been going to Markham Station for years, I love the breakfast especially because they serve it all day! The service is fast and by now I know most of the staff by name. \\n\\nI recommend this please highly. One of my fav\\'s, this place is open 24hrs w/ breakfast! Service is awesome and quick! Food rocks! It\\'s really cool! Use to be good, used to be my favourite.  Now...forget it.  The servers are rude and the food is disgusting. I haven\\'t been here for years, but it\\'s nice to see this place is still opened For business....only because it\\'s opened 24hrs.\\nThe place is spacious,  always opened, serves all day breakfast and comfort diner foods. From fish n chips, burgers n fries to souvlaki,  soups and sandwiches. \\nTheir prices are very reasonable and the portions are always satisfying.......\\nHowever....yes however,  their credibility for freshness was uncertain. My bro and I came here Saturday afternoon for lunch, while he had the pork souvlaki dinner, I ordered their one of their favorites,  quiche Lorraine and Cesar salad. At $12.99 the price was reasonable, however when my dish arrived parts of the outer crusts of my quiche had fallen off. At that point my first thought was damn! It must be frozen, and at first bite I was correct, though warm, it was spongy and soggy inside.  The salad was great, and when I questioned my waitress about the quiche she advised it they make their quiche ahead of time and store them in the freezer........ yup...I think next time I\\'ll have to opt for a less fancier and more diner - diner dive type of meal lol. Service was friendly and efficient. ...but still a disappointment. Went here after a night out on the town with a group of friends.  Having been to similar breakfast / diner type places, I can\\'t say that I was overly impressed with the food here.  I ordered the cajun burger, which game with fries, and was ok -- it satisfied my hunger pangs without stuffing me, but really wasn\\'t anything to rave about.  I may end up back here to meet up with friends after hours, but it wouldn\\'t be my choice of venue. The Markham Station is the best place to go for breakfast or pretty much anything. The people who work there are so amazingly friendly and kind I went there multiple times. Every time its a disappointment and i can say this is the least disappointing visit so far . Food is outdated and tastes weird. Their fries, bread, and eggs always taste old,dry,and bland. Not the best service too. Went on a Monday morning, and again on Thursday morning.  Both times, decent food, especially the breakfast special.  However both times also horrid waiters--different waiters, but learned from the same school of rudeness--let us stand at the front about 5 minutes while chatting with other employees, then grunted and pointed to a table for us to go to.  Both times the forks were dirty (spoons and knives OK) and we had to ask the waiter to sweep the crumbs off the seats.  We noticed the waitresses were friendly and efficient, but the waiters were the opposite.  We had to go get the waiter to get coffee refills.  Washrooms were tiny and filthy; no TP in the men\\'s.  The first time we tipped as usual, assuming the waiter just had a bad day.  The second time we gave our tip to one of the waitresses who noticed we needed more coffee even though it wasn\\'t her table.  The roasted potatoes were really good, but the home fries were very dry and tasted like they were over baked frozen potatoes. This place is much nicer after the upgrades. The staff have always been friendly and the food is pretty decent. It\\'s open 24 hours which is great when you get the late night menchies.\\n\\nOh yeah their fries tastes like McDonald\\'s but no complaints here. I came here to appease my family when they suggested this place a day for breakfast.  After my last experiences i was determined to avoid this place.\\n\\nEdible enough food with spotty service on weekends. Basically Your staple breakfast foods (eggs, homefries, sausage, toast and coffee). \\n\\nMy one major peeve is the lack of quicker service on my past 2 visits this year. Moreover the quality of service. The coffee comes with free refills, when I was a kid I recall the servers coming by frequently. I had to flag the servers down multiple times for this. The servers are polite, but I guess it\\'s difficult to manage on busier days?\\n\\n\\nI come here, think of my childhood, come\\nWith my parents. I guess it\\'s tradition, but I remember it being way way better. But I think it\\'s time I convince my brother to love\\nEggsmart more than this place. Food is okay but man it felt like I took off 5 years off my life after eating the onion rings. The batter was thick and soaked in oil. I rather they have less batter and be sliced then so they are more crispy. These were like super huge onion rings. The burger is on par with Harvey\\'s but I think Harvey\\'s burgers are a bit more juicy and thick. I got the banquet burger and it came with cheese and bacon. For about $5 its not bad but found the bacon to be a bit tough and hard like its been sitting for a while. The decor is really old school. It looks like the original signs for the menu were the original ones used from when they first opened and it looks like something from the 80\\'s. Will I be back? Probably not since Harvey\\'s is right across the street but may consider to try their breakfast if I\\'m really desperate. Man if you come for their breakfast specials from 6am to 11am for 5.99 this place is definitely a 5*. Their food is good and where else can you get so much breakfast food for only 5.99??? I believe it comes with 3 eggs 3 sausages 3 bacon, home fries and toast. \\n\\nI\\'ve never made it up for that but I have come here for brunch a bunch of times and the food is really great normally as well. I\\'m surprised at the low rating since this place is huge and seems to always have a very decent amount of people dining in it at any time in the day. Actually maybe it\\'s because most of it is old people and they don\\'t use Yelp..\\n\\nOnly thing is sometimes I crave peanut butter and they don\\'t carry it. But whatever. Also, the servers are generally quite nice too. What can I say. Markham station is alright. They seem to be more charming/the food tastes better during those twilight hours, and I\\'ve heard service doesn\\'t suck as bad as it does during the daylight. Yes, it IS because your ham showed...\\n\\nI usually go for their souvlaki - which is overpriced, 14.99 for pork and a whopping 17.99 for chicken. Yikes. But, you do get a fair amount of food, and the skewers of meat are quite nicely broiled and charred. I got the pork just yesterday and was quite satisfied - it comes with generously dressed Greek salad, a serving of rice, a really good amount of tzatziki and their fabulous marinated potatoes, the pork was also flavorful and a delight to eat.\\n\\nTheir menu says \"30 minute seating limit\" in fine print (lulz WHAT?)\\n\\nFor $2.39 you only get one free refill with your coffee (Really?)\\n\\nTheir orange juice is basically puddle water.\\n\\nAnd their service is shitty, slow and sub-par.\\n\\nFigures because Scarborough is wasteland. Lovely server, awful food. Came Thursday afternoon, so place wasn\\'t busy. Ordered eggs with home fries, toast, and sausage. Came out incredibly quickly but the food was cold. Got the server to take it back but again it came out quickly and clearly the food had just been reheated - I could see where I had eaten from and the pepper I had added. Maybe we needed to specify we wanted fresh food?? Lost my appetite. Never returning. It\\'s been a few years since I\\'ve eaten here, but first time since they\\'ve renovated. There\\'s lots of choice here so there shouldn\\'t be any problem finding something to eat.\\n\\nCame here at 12:30pm on a Saturday and was able to get a seat right away. Ordered the eggs (sunny side up) with sausages and home fries. Toast is deliciously buttered, but today the home fries weren\\'t as crispy as I\\'d like them to be. \\n\\nIf you want all day breakfast, you can\\'t go wrong with this place. To get the best value, make sure you get there before 11am. \\n\\nThe service is lacking though as we had empty glasses for quite a while. When I asked for more water, they only gave us one glass. And left the other glasses empty. \\n\\n4/5 for food and value\\n2/5 for service I used to work in Scarborough. It was nine years ago. My colleagues and I used to come to this restaurant. I have not been back until today. \\n\\nThe outside of the restaurant looks the same. I got a decent parking spot and walked in. \\n\\nThe restaurant\\'s interior got a makeover. Gone are the bluish-green booth seats that looked like they were from the 60\\'s. Instead, the interior looks modern and classy. \\n\\nI was hungry. I was going for lunch at nearly 5 pm. I went with the super breakfast. I love a good all-day breakfast. The super comes with three eggs the way that you\\'d like them, three pancakes, three sausage links, three slices of bacon, a cantaloupe wedge, and your choice of rice, roasted potatoes, or home fries. I went with roasted potatoes. I like that there wasn\\'t any toast. I would have exploded if I got some!\\n\\nService was fast. I got my food in less than ten minutes. I also got a Diet Coke to wash my meal down. It was good. Perhaps more grease than I\\'m used to, but it was yummy. I loved the roasted potatoes. They are those that you expect when you order souvlaki. \\n\\nThe downside was the washrooms. Three tight stalls are there. Only one person can use the sink. There is little space to open the door to get out. It\\'s cramped. \\n\\nI\\'d come back again for a quick meal. The hours are decent and I liked the prompt service. \\n\\n(79) Updated to add that the new decor is beautiful but please bring back the edible salad bowls!!! I haven\\'t come here for the breakfast before, but my friends have. Seems pretty standard (but good). I think food wise this place is pretty consistent. It\\'s not amazing, but it\\'s good enough to fill your belly. \\n\\nThe staff here are laid back and friendly. It\\'s normally pretty busy when I visit, but I haven\\'t ever had any issues with the service.\\n\\nGoing to give it three stars for now as I haven\\'t had any problems and generally had a good time while here. Not bad, it\\'s like your typical breakfast food. \\nIt is obvious that they precook your bacon, sausage, home fries and pancakes (well the things I\\'ve ordered) and simply cook the eggs when ordered. Our food came out really quickly (5 minutes after ordering). I am not really a fan of that as most of our breakfast places will cook to order - even the bacon and sausages. It\\'s more fresh that way! \\nTheir coffee however has no taste. \\nIf you are looking for a cook to order place, this is not the one. If you\\'re looking for a relatively fast, and cheapish breakfast place, then you\\'ve found it! \\nI would probably not find myself here as it is relatively far for me to get to and I could probably find at least 5 breakfast restaurants before getting there! \\nIf I was around the corner, I would probably come here more often for their relatively cheap prices. And of course, try their lunch/dinner menu, which I have done years back! \\nAlso, as a ketchup user, it was really hard getting it out of the bottle!!! I like that this place is open 24/7. It\\'s so convenient when you\\'re out late at night (like 3am) and there\\'s nothing else open. Markham Station offers decently sized portions of food, no complaints there. Pricing of the menu can be kinda on the expensive side, I mean, considering the value of the food\\'s quality and taste falls short of impressive. It\\'s just really average to me. They do have early bird specials though, which is always a plus! Was there with a few friends last night.  Even though we arrived past midnight on a weekday, it was surprising to see quite a few customers dining there.\\n\\nUpon being seated, the first thing I did was order a hot chocolate to warm me up, as it was -20 degrees outside.  Waited for 25 minutes, before I had to remind the waitress again....no biggie.\\n\\nFood was pretty standard diner fare.  Ordered the club sandwich, which came with a cup of mayo on the side (nice touch).  Reasonably tasty, but not the best I\\'ve had by any stretch.  \\n\\nI did notice they serve pretty big portions for pretty much any dish....my friends seemed quite content with whatever they ordered.\\n\\nOverall good experience, and would recommend to anyone looking for some late-night grub.  Don\\'t expect to be blown away by the food...,but you will get your stomach filled. Note: This review is written based on my experience at the take-out portion of the restaurant. The experience dining in may be, and likely is, different or perhaps more impressive.\\n\\nBeing in a rush, we popped in here to get some quick grub - for this purpose, this place did the trick. Ended up ordering a \"Banquet Burger,\" that had a good amount of bacon, but a kraft singles slice of cheese, on a frozen patty. I liked how they allowed you to order from a decent selection of toppings. Since I wasn\\'t expecting a gourmet burger for take-out, I don\\'t have too many complaints here - would still go for Harvey\\'s those at that quality and price-point.\\n\\nThe onion rings, I must say, were amazing here. This surprised me, as they were perhaps the best onion rings I\\'ve ever had - thick, juicy, crispy, and plentiful. I\\'ll come back for the rings if I\\'m in the area, but probably not for anything else. Recently moved into the area and was told that i could get a good breakfast at this The Markham Station.\\n\\nThe Good\\n\\n1. Breakfast starts at $5.99 standard bacon, eggs and toast\\n\\n2. Large restaurant plenty of spaced out seating unlike most breakfast places where you feel the next table and including the people waiting for a table are sitting on top of you.\\n\\n3. Plenty of servers that are switched on and to be honest very good at what they do\\n\\nWell my experience came here on Sunday I was not in the mood for Eggs however the wife had the $5.99 special, asked her how it was and told that it was good pretty standard stuff.\\n\\nI decided to order a steak sandwich for $11.99 all i have to say is disappointing.  The fries were shoestring not properly cooked and limp.  The steak was overcooked i asked for medium rare and got leather.\\n\\nFor $11.99 the steak used in the sandwich should be bigger not a small fast fry 4oz steak that was served.  The bun used for the steak should not be larger than the meat inside which i must add was overly toasted. Overall my meal was dry and not appetizing at all. Apple juice was overly sweetened.  No selection of decaf teas offered disappointed that they did not even carry Chamomile \\n\\nWill i be back probably not breakfast and greasy spoons are a dime a dozen especially within this area.\\n\\nOh the three stars are mostly for service How I ended up at The Markham Station Restaurant?\\n\\nNothing is open on a Sunday before 7 AM for breakfast!! I called Eggsmart....Cora\\'s... nothing is open aside from The Markham Station.. but they never really close anyway??\\n\\n$4.99 All the Breakfast cheap...but not the breakfast I would like to have often.. maybe I might go to MacDonald instead.... yes it was that bad!!\\n\\nSausages dripping in oil... I guess they deep fried them?? When I bite into one.. the oil just dripping everywhere.... The roasted potato though reminds me of potato boiled with tomato paste....which my friend enjoyed.. \\n\\nOnly 2 free refills for coffee ($2) and minimum charge is $3 per person.. as I can imagine some customers might hang out for hours and try drinking free refills of coffee the whole day.\\n\\nServices here are lacking, the waitress were all so laidback..and has this 70s small town vibes, which definitely match the atmosphere of the place!\\n\\nWill I come back?? Probably not? BTW, there is a McDonalds that opens 24 hours just up the street.. just saying....\\n\\nFYI: CP 24 is ON! If I am rating just the food.....4 star\\'s. On wait time and service? A generous 3...we were seated right away. But  it took almost 40 min to get our food. The place was clean and was not too loud but maybe they were understaffed in the kitchen? Or it being a Beautiful Sunday morning there was alot of traffic. How does this restaurant stay in business?  The service is absolutely horrible, and the food is mediocre. The waiter makes you feel like you owe him a favour. When you complain to the manager, he tries to pretend like everything is okay by saying \"it\\'s okay, he just needs a break right? Right? Right?\" while tapping you on the shoulder like he\\'s your friend.\\nUPDATE:\\nSo I think the waiter realized he was being a prick and tried to make up for his attitude. I\\'ll bump the rating from 1 to 2 stars because he actually made an attempt to redeem himself. I adore Markham Station. Cheap great greasy food, open 24 hours. The ladies here are almost always sweet as honey, too. Just avoid the take out place next door, just come and sit and enjoy some cheap yummy eggs and bacon at 4 am. Or 9 pm. Whatever. I came here with the impression that it was just going to be another diner, but I was quite taken aback when I saw it was a full service restaurant.\\n\\nCame here on a craving for some food and didn\\'t feel like the 24h McD.  So after driving down Sheppard (learned my lesson not to do that next time I go there) I finally found this place that is not quite so little or hole-in-the-wall as I was expecting.\\n\\nSo I decided to order a typical diner type order: steak and poached eggs.  The food wasn\\'t super good, but it is better than a Chinese diner that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nThe price was a bit more expensive (like three times the price of D&R Wing)  for what you get, but then again it\\'s 3:30am so if you need some food  (and much better than that of Metro Square, Olive\\'s Restaurant and D&R Wing) \\n\\nThe food is also significantly better than the Perfect 24h Chinese Restaurant.\\n\\nI would likely come back here again if I have a late night craving, probably get the Chocolate Cheesecake (the description on the menu sounds tasty).  However, I don\\'t know if I would go here if other restaurants are still open.  I\\'ll see how it goes on my next trip there. Gotta pick your battles at this place\\n\\nBurger and cheese fries. Anything else and you may be disappointed. Went there this morning with my parents and kids for breakfast, and i have to say, off the hop, i was totally floored by the belligerent waiter we had.  Aggressive and rude, he cut me off when i ordered my food.  i only wanted two eggs, but he said, \"I\\'m not serving you the two eggs.  you can have the 3 egg plate for the same price as the two eggs.  I didn\\'t want 3 eggs, and i certainly didn\\'t care if it was the same price.  It is a waste and i could\\'t finish the 3 eggs anyway.\\nAt that point we should have left, because the food was terrible to boot.  the eggs were oily as was the peameal bacon.  My son ordered chicken fingers and they were terrible.  He didn\\'t touch them.\\nAs we were getting ready to leave, the waiter was at the table behind us. They were a group of late teen aged men.  i heard him say to the one ordering, \"um...i can see your lips moving but i can\\'t hear a word coming out of your mouth.\"  What a complete ass.   He had a constant look of disdain on his face, as if he would rather be anywhere else than there.  \\nI did tell the hostess on the way out that he was very rude and he shouldn\\'t be working with people. \\nif you do go here, and you get this server, ask to change tables immediately.  As soon as he opens his mouth to talk, you\\'ll know exactly who I\\'m talking about. Standard greasy diner fare but heck I only came here for the Station Cheesy fries and it was good. You get a huge platter of it and its loaded up with cheese and bacon. Can\\'t ask for anything more, just wanted a simple indulgence. Servers are really nice and it\\'s a huge place, shouldn\\'t have problems getting a table no matter what time you show up here. I\\'m Scarborough born and raised. Lots of people swear by this place but don\\'t listen to them. I\\'ve been here twice, once at night and once in the morning, and both times were... boring. \\n\\nEveryone in the area knows about Markham Station. The spot for night owls needing their fix. I ordered the usual breakfast meal and got something I honestly could\\'ve made better at home. The eggs and meat were just ok but the home fries were bad. Worst home fries of any breakfast spot ever. They\\'re so bland! \\n\\nSave your taste buds and hit up Honey B instead. It\\'s up the road, also open 24/7, and has better food. Overall Markham Station gets a 2/5 This is the Scarborough-equivalent establishment to Smoke\\'s Poutinerie/Burrito Boyz when you want something late-night.  \\n\\nIt has been around for a long time and the food here is cheap.  If you come late at night, you will get the occasional ruckus from the drunks but overall not a bad place to grab a bite when you should be sleeping.\\n\\nThe standard breakfast joint fare: steak and eggs, omelets, fries, salads, french toast.  \\n\\nDon\\'t expect stellar service, you\\'re at their mercy because when it\\'s 4AM and you are getting post-liquor hunger pangs, you need them more than they need you! Ok so, second time I\\'ve ever been here and I\\'m not sure I\\'ll be back. Food was fine but I asked for a spinach and mozzarella cheese omelette but asked for cheddar instead of mozzarella they charged me for a cheese omelette with an add on of spinach. Seems really petty to me to charge me for something different than I asked to get an extra $1.50 on the bill. Is that wrong of me to assume you can just swap out cheeses or am I being petty?\\n\\n3 stars just because the food was good. Why do people like this place? The service sucks and the food tastes like cardboard. The price is cheap, but why settle for such bad food just for the price? You\\'re better off going to any fast food joint in town.\\n\\nI ordered a fruit bowl and all the fruit was old and brown coloured. I ordered a Spanish omelette and it looked like something a 10 year old attempted to make at home for the first time in his / her life. I had the orange juice and it tasted like the cheapest brand of OJ available. If they even used Tropicana or Simply Orange, it would taste a lot better than what they served us.\\n\\nMcdonald\\'s is also 24/7 and any item there tastes better than this place. Let\\'s not use the excuse of price here. I\\'ve been all over North America and Europe, any \"cheap\" breakfast place I\\'ve experienced in the past absolutely destroys this place. The only reason I checked this place out was because it;s open 24/7 and nothing else was open, it has generally poor reviews and I can honestly say that\\'s a pretty accurate sum up. I ordered from the all day breakfast menu, (50z Chicken breast with 3 eggs, hash brown,choice of sides) Which was $11.\\n\\nThe chicken was surprisingly decent, not too dry. The eggs were good (how can you mess eggs up), hash brown were terrible, It was stale and not crispy, and not very hot either. Most likely frozen. Toast was decent.\\n\\nFor $11 I think you\\'re getting ripped off, If you calculate the food cost it was probably $2 max. They try to fill the plate with lots of hash browns and toast. Generally the menu was expensive for seemingly how little you get.\\n\\nIf It\\'s late and that\\'s the only place possible for you, then go, if not, there are many other great 24/7 places. Today was my first visit after the renovations and loved it! Only complaint about this place would be that once we walked in, we seen a waiter and we said excuse me to get a seat and he called over another waitress to give us a seat? He was a bit rude about it.\\n\\nOther than that, a Chinese woman was our waitress and she was so kind! Checked up on how we were doing a couple of times and provided us the right condiments.. Didn\\'t even need to ask for anything! \\n\\nThe food was amazing!! I came here often before the renovation and for some reason, even though the prices were good, the food was whatever. Today the food was amazing! I got two eggs, with sausage, home fries & white toast. Craving was def satisfied. I\\'ve been to Markham Station a handful of times and I never had high expectations but my last experience was absolutely horrible.\\n\\nWe went during very late hours and there were very few customers. The staff were too lazy to greet us at the door and we sat at one of the tables they pointed us to. It took way too long for the server to come by to take our orders (approximately 15 minutes, even though she only served a few tables). We ordered a Steak Sandwich and Cannelloni. As mentioned before, I did not have high expectations but our food was very sub-par. The steak had a very pale brown colour to it and it did not looked like it was grilled. The cannelloni was very cheesy but also lacked taste.\\n\\nThe worse part of our experience had to be the service. Our drinks came much after our food arrived and our server was not only rude to us but also to other customers. As mentioned before, they did not seat customers but rather point to tables. One couple came in and did not want to sit where the server pointed so they moved to another table without talking to the server. Under the server\\'s breath, I could hear her say \"ok sit where ever the hell you want\". The couple probably should have asked the server but that type of language is unacceptable to paying customers.\\n\\nAfter our terrible experience, I left no tip and I can hear the server saying we were cheap. Very unprofessional. I will never go back. I would give this place less than one star if I could. We waited for 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table and when we called a passing waiter she rudely ignored us and then went on to say how our waitress was coming. Again another 20 minute wait before we called someone over to find someone to help us. The service was terrible and I understand as it was Sunday morning that they would be busy but this was ridiculous. Food was not especially good and service was really not that great. Went here on a Saturday morning for brunch and service was slow even though it wasn\\'t that busy. To be honest the food was edible for a prison inmate. Service was just as good \\nhow do places like this stay open?'],\n",

       "  'After seeing this place pop up on Yelp and being featured in a newsletter/blog that I follow I decided to give these guys a try. They\\'re only a 10 minute walk from my house so I thought this would be a great opportunity to find a new brunch spot close to home. I popped in Saturday morning with my girlfriend only to find out that they\\'re doing brunch on Sundays only at the moment.\\n\\nNo matter, I grabbed a tea to go, of which I had 4 choices of loose leaf varieties to choose from. The woman working was very friendly and explained how they\\'re taking things one step at a time and slowly introducing more and more. \\n\\nRight now this is a great place to hang out during the day to grab a hot beverage and chit-chat with a friend or come in the evening for a cocktail or two. No open Wifi networks popped up during my visit so this may not be the place at the moment to hang out if you\\'re trying to get work done/being a laptop hobo. Been here twice, enjoyed it both times. Great craft beer selection, everything from hoppy IPAs to sweet Belgian ales. Also an impressive cocktail menu, with some delicious concoctions. Try the Ruby for something sweet, or the Jacket Pocket for something a little more bracing\\nGreat intimate atmosphere, low lighting. Music and ambient noise is a little loud later in the evening. Place got busier the second time I was there, probably due to getting written up on BlogTO. Lots of hipsters Richard P from Northwood is now messaging me trying to convince me of the benefits of their \\'tab\\' system.  See my previous review, it does not work. He says its hard to do separate bills and a lot of work for servers and customers (huh?!)...so they don\\'t want to do it. I wonder how all those other restaurants do it? Magic? Actually when you do split bills its so nice and easy for the customer and we love it!! For now I\\'ll continue to avoid this place at all costs.\\n\\nRichard P\\'s private messages to me explicitly told me that they do NOT do separate bills. They do allow you to try and calculate what you owe on the one bill that you receive, but that is NOT a separate bill. He also\" justified\" to me in previous messages why northwood doesn\\'t do separate bills,  so I\\'m not sure what his comment to my review even means. Regardless, I will never return after the rude service I received. As the server at the last restaurant I went to told me \"of course I can do separate bills for you, and any place that says they can\\'t is lying or has severely outdated equipment\" \\n\\nIf anyone wants clarification on what was sent to me, feel free to pm me! :) I came to Northwood for birthday drinks and left not at all disappointed -- which was a feat considering that the running theme of my birthday for the past few years is disappointment. Northwood is the type of place that feels like it fell right out of my dreams, and it would definitely go into the regular rotation if I was local. Perfectly friendly and non-intrusive service, makes a mean cocktail, serves coffee, and open til 2:00 am? Yes please.\\n\\nThe time of year plus inclement weather meant that it wasn\\'t busy when I visited, which made the atmosphere all the better for lingering over perfectly balanced cocktails. I selected the Pretty Vengeance for quaffing, and enjoyed it so much that I promptly ordered a second. If I could have torn myself away, I would have ordered one of the other delicious-sounding offerings, but there\\'s a time and a place to stick with the tried and true (the time is your birthday, and the place is Northwood).\\n\\nI will be back, even as I attempt to recreate the sweet nectar created by combining vodka, vanilla liqueur, vermouth, pear, and cardamom for home enjoyment. I recently started going to Northwood with a couple of friends to do some work during the afternoon. I really like the atmosphere and the service, as the staff is nice and attentive. The decor of the place is fitting as it both a bar and café, and the tables are comfortable to sit on. The best part about the place, for those of us who have an incessant need to be connected to the grid, is the ample amount of plugs. I don\\'t understand places that do not provide sufficient plugs for their customers--many of whom are graduate students or young professionals--, because it means that people who would become regulars--and spend more money--simply don\\'t. I used to be a regular at another café nearby, but since they do not have many plugs--it was somewhat like Lord the Flies in there--I have opted to go to Northwood instead. In addition, they have free and fast wifi. My new favorite place. The atmosphere was both intimate and welcoming. We had prompt and friendly service and without doubt the best cocktails I\\'ve yet to experience in Toronto. Would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone. Finally! A place where I can drink high quality tea while my boyfriend can drink high quality booze \\n\\nSweet concept for sure This is one of my own main haunts on Bloor West. The cocktails are awesome, the ambiance is wonderful for meeting up with friends, and I\\'m really happy that they\\'ve recently expanded their food offerings. Check out the rotating weekly dinner specials, I\\'ve eaten on my own a few times and also have dined with friends. I went for dinner with a party of four with mixed dietary needs (one vegan & g/f, one g/f omnivore, two omnivores who will eat anything) and we all walked away happy and well fed. That night I loved the pickle plate, beet tartare (yes beets!), the white bean dip, and some perfectly cooked brussel sprouts. As for the cocktails, I\\'m a gin drinker and love the Paper Moon, the Paradis is also quite nice. The newest hipster cafe/bar/saloon to hit Bloorcourt and the first really big makeover on this block in recent years, Northwood is brand new, opening its doors yesterday. The atmosphere was really enjoyable and relaxed but then again, there was only a trickle of customers coming in and discovering the place.\\n\\nIf you ever entered Regal Gardens, the Chinese restaurant that pre-dated Northwood, the interior is not even recognizable in a wonderful way. They did a complete gut. The east wall is now exposed brick, a long bar on the west side featuring an eclectic cage holding all the liquor, a chalk board menu of preferred uppers and downers and a mish mash of old schoolhouse chairs, wicker bar stools, wooden benches and sturdy retro pub chairs. \\n\\nIt\\'s got that nostalgic dive bar feel without the actual griminess or smell, maybe because it\\'s only seen one night of patrons so far but I appreciate this. It\\'s clear a lot of thought went into the place and the furnishings, which is really refreshing.\\n\\nThe staff are friendly, the coffee is good, the selection of sweeteners includes coconut sugar and maple sugar. I even had an enjoyable vegan cookie. \\n\\nMenu and brunch to come. I was promised vegan options which is enough to win my return patronage and if it\\'s good, make me a regular. I did not check out the liquor but hopefully they have a nice selection of local and craft beers, as places like this are inclined to.\\n\\nThe only drawback I saw was the extra .50c for soy-based drinks. Down with the soy tax! Been here a few times and despite trying other places we end up wanting to come back! The drinks are so good! We are hooked on the amazing varieties. Black walnut! White lodge! And death and company spin offs! Wish there was more finger food though! Ambience is great as well! Low key and not pretentious! I want to go again now!! Came here for a friend\\'s birthday. Relaxed atmosphere, good selection of beers, moderately priced and good music. The place is a bit heavy on the moustaches and plaid, but a good time was had by all. It\\'s small, so if you\\'ve got a big group, get there early! The owner has Phd in Film.... no wonder the lighting is sensational! I\\'ve never seen better lighting in a bar. \\n\\nSpecialty cocktails are great. Lady Grey Sour... original and tasty.\\n\\nYogi Berra might say... \"Nobody goes there anymore, it\\'s too crowded\". The last time I walked by, I wanted to stop in, but it was kind of packed. Another favourite local hangout. I usually go here because Northwood has some of the best coffee in the city--aside from Lit/Crema. The baristas do a great job, and they never mess up the espresso. Also, the cocktails are super inventive. \\n\\nI was here for brunch a few weeks ago, and it was delicious. I had the Northwood after explaining gluten allergies to the server. The bacon was really good quality, and the eggs were perfectly poached. I can confirm that the potatoes were crispy as advertised. In the middle of a major snowstorm what does one do when there is an event hosted  by the Legendary Jennifer K well one braves the elements and digs in further. \\nThis spot is not that far from a subway stop though it did feel like quite a walk given the snow packed sidewalk. In summer one will hardly notice the distance. \\nNevertheless all the gloom disappeared when I saw the host sitting at the bar enjoying a drink.\\nThe setup is simple yet effective. They had a happy hour going on a Saturday till 7 for some draft drinks but I had to order a bottle of ST BERNARDUS ABT 12  since the first batch sold out at LCBO. The server was a bit taken aback as I guess not many people order this bottle and brought out the wrong glass at first and even had a bit of trouble opening the bottle. Nevertheless having it on the list is good enough in my book. The place has a laid back feel and is good spot to chat and enjoy, or just unwind which alright in my book.\\nA great start to a great evening (or one can call it a good place to end a miserable day)\\n3.5 Stars. \\nWill be back for sure. Northwood is far too often overlooked regarding their well thought out beer menu. With excellent options in style and brewery range, this place is a win! Recently they have started offering a more substantial food menu and it is all homemade and VERY tasty! Service is friendly, efficient and well informed. Oh and P.S. their coffee is delicious too! I was at Northwood on Friday August 8, 2014 with some friends.\\n\\nFirst the place has the worst menu...one of the dish is white beans blended in house with some dry bread! seriously!! you could at least use real beans. It tasted like water sewage. I am still washing my mouth from that.\\n\\nNow I was Ok with that after all it is a drinking place so I did not go there for the food.\\n\\nNow we were a big group. We asked them to split our bills since we were drinking and we were not attached by the hips! The answer was no we do not do that unless you wanna give us your credit card and we open a tap. My boyfriend and I said yes to this. We gave our visa and order drinks and some lame food as follows:\\n\\nGinger ale\\n3 beers\\nthat awful white beans with the dry bread\\nsome even more awful cheese (I really hate French wanna be restaurants)\\none scotch\\none cider\\n*extra side dish of bread.\\n\\nNow, my b/f and I wanted to leave the party earlier so I approached the over worked bartender. I should mention now the place gets busy and they are very under staffed. I told him we had a tap and I would like to clear it. He gave me a bill and I noticed the scotch and three beers were missing...I told him about this omission....you see I could just not mention about this but I am a normal citizen not a thief!\\n\\nHe went back and added the drinks...here is my problem. He ADDED what I told him was missing but DID NOT TAKE IT OUT OF WHERE ELSE HE HAD IT! I mean yea busy but it is not my job to move drinks from one tap to another.\\n\\nNow one of my friend called me the next day and told me they over charged her exactly those 4 drinks that I told him he was missing.  I sent the receipt to my friend and told her that it was paid in full except that side bread.\\n\\nI  forgot to mention the extra sad bread order was not on my bill. I told my friend I am sorry I forgot the extra stupid bread...but I was pissed the restaurant charged my friends for something ALREADY PAID FOR!\\n\\nNow this is my advise to Northwood or any other bar establishment serving groups that are not gonna all come together or leave together and not providing 5star menu: \\n\\nIf you are too cheap to have a system where you can put numbers so people can have different bills, perhaps you should not be in the bar business. No 10 people go to a place to have drinks and need to wait until the end of the night to pay all at the same time!!!!!! this is stupid!\\n\\nYou are Bloor and Ossington, a place to go before you go somewhere else...read your targets!!!\\n\\nIf you think your staff cannot keep track of who drinks what (assuming your staff is sober), funny you assumed your drinking patrons should do the calculations and the remembering! \\n\\nIt all boiled down to service. Your service sucks. You basically robbed my friend.\\n\\nI will never be back at the Northwood and I hope you do not rip off others like you did to us. Also BTW, your staff was defensive...not sure if this was being overworked or underpaid or just cranky but guess what, I wished I did not tip you...\\n\\nHave good short life. Not only is the decor cute and atmosphere hip and welcoming, but their good is unique and delicious. I loved the white bean dip and all their sandwiches looked amazing. Also if I could have the waiter with the ice blue eyes again that would be fantastic. My husband and I came here with the baby on a lazy Sunday afternoon while our 3 year old was with a family member.   It was pleasantly busy, and we managed to snag a 4-top by the window.   Service was pleasant and fast.  They have 4 or 5 beers on tap, including two from Beau\\'s Brewery (yum)!  They also had a full cocktail menu, if that\\'s your thing.   \\n\\nThe day we came they were doing a pop-up brunch, $20 pp for an appetizer, main, and dessert.  We are vegan, and that wasn\\'t a problem at all.  The food was delicious and creatively done.    Other than that, they had some baked goods on offer, but I didn\\'t see any vegan options for those (I could be wrong though).    \\n\\nOne of the bartenders is my fave bartender who used to work at Disgraceland down the street, and she\\'s a total sweetheart and is GREAT at what she does.  I would love to come back here at night and check out the vibe.  \\n\\nOne complaint:  I really wish that they had drip coffee.  I almost took off a 1/2 star, but I really liked this space so much that I couldn\\'t bring myself to do it. I came here for drinks after Karaoke and they had an excellent selection of cocktails and other late night drinks. The atmosphere was great and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly. It\\'s a very chilled out spot with fun loungey music that makes it feel very intimate. Don\\'t come here expecting to dance or be rowdy, it\\'s not that type of crowd. The perfect place to down a few bottles of Dieu du Ciel Rosée d\\'Hibiscus in the middle of winter when you\\'re really missing summer. Love the mood lighting and actual candles this place has - full of character without trying too hard. Every time I return to Toronto this is my first stop for a gorgeous cocktail. The real deal. Best on the block. Homemade bitters, aged cider, crafts beers & a ton more & my favourite the Choupette - elderflower, lemon, thyme and gin. The snack menu is pretty yummy too, I usually go for the plate of pickled veg.\\n\\nThe space is super cool yet romantic. Percect for a date or hang. They\\'ve usually got a great DJ spinning too.\\n\\nDuring the day, the coffee is aces and the space is a dream for getting work done. I came here for a Yelp event was very impressed by the nice intimate setting for a bar and the very friendly bartenders.  \\n\\nI had one of their cocktails called the \"Lady Grey Sour\", which was an Earl Grey rye, lemon and black pepper.  It went down very smooth.  That can be dangerous for me. Anyways, the assortment of drinks is very good and is definitely a good bar. It\\'s hard to imagine this placed once house a chinese restaurant selling shit on a tray. \\n\\nThe owners of Northwood have transformed it into a cafe-cocktail lounge, doing random pop up dinners every so often, and real cocktails at night. I\\'m very appreciative that they serve cocktails the traditional way, with blocks of ice to ensure your drink doesn\\'t get watered down. At $10 a cocktail, it\\'s very reasonable for the two ounce pour delicious tasting mixed drinks Their 10th & Arch (bourbon, maple syrup base is delicious on so many levels. The Lady Grey Sour was very unique to say the least. Also, they carry a great selection of beers and some that i didn\\'t even know were still brewed (when was the last time you say anyone actually carry Stroh in Toronto). \\n\\nThe place does get packed fast, and it\\'s gaining popularity fast. So be prepared for that and arrive early. Just go to Northwood, it speaks for itself.\\n\\nI have been here a number of times, and the first time was a spontaneous choice as my boyfriend had just heard that a bar opened up around the corner from our apartments. So I went, and we brought along his out of town friends as well. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is fantastic, not exactly a sea storm of young and beautiful and young and restless youths doll\\'d up to indulge in the consumption of sweet sweet liquid luck that will hopefully lead them to sweet sweet bedroom luck. \\n\\nNot that you cannot achieve that, I mean, their beer menu has the most amazing selection ranging from local blends, to Deu du Ciel, Cheval Blanc, and Beau\\'s (a personal preference)! And the cocktail artist makes fantastic gin creations, also their bourbon is...well...as good as bourbon can excel to be. And the music is soulful! \\n\\nBut what I am trying to get at is that in Northwood, there is a crowd that will appreciate your chiller conversational mood, and will happily adapt to your fluctuating happy intoxicated and comically conversational mood as you keep ordering lovely rounds of lovely things!\\n\\nSometimes they will have an amazing chef in the house, he will cook up the most amazing pop up menu for dinner, or tiny bites, or just midnight snacks that go really well with the fantastic musical accompaniment that they will provide on certain wonderful evenings. If there isn\\'t a DJ spinning very soulful jazz and funk vinyls to ignite your conversational moods, then there will be a DJ spinning really earthy shoe gaze rock and roll beats as they dim the lights so your refreshing moods are the only things that light up the atmosphere at night. Once, Brandan Canning was there spinning, along with a chef, but I could not go. Like their facebook page because they will update you on sweet events, and specialty beers being added! \\n\\nAlso, a perk, they are open daily from 10am to 2am!\\n\\nSo what are you supposed to do at Northwood at 10am? \\n\\nWell, the cafe atmosphere there is amazing, I go there for  conversation dates, reading, and sometimes get a nook in the corner with a tab growing with Americano orders and just do my homework all day. The barista there is a fantastic person! The coffee creations are amazing, the music is delightful, the crowd is a wonderful mixture of the most interesting and exciting and sometimes the most calming people you may want to start a conversation with, or merely just exchange a smile and a laugh with or ask for the time. \\n\\nI love it here. It\\'s exactly what the growing suburban and urban members of the Chirstie Pits neighbourhood needed to come together and be happy. Stopped in for a quiet Sunday night. Staff was kind and prompt. The toddy warmed us up, and the wine was lovely. The lighting really made the place feel intimate and almost secret like a speak easy. Northoods brings a decent bar to an area of Toronto that has somehow been devoid of good bars, although it\\'s an awesome place if you like kimchi and soon tofu.\\n\\nThe DRINKS: \\n--BEER: They have a pretty extensive bottle list, all at rather high mark-ups, 3-4 times LCBO prices.  They have a decent but not amazing draft list.  Lots of focus on Beau\\'s, which is one of the weaker Ontario breweries.  I was astonished to drink a tasty, but standard-production Beau\\'s for $9.50/pint.  Woah, that\\'s crazy-town pricing.  Thankfully, happy hour made it normal for $2 off, but there\\'s no excuse to price a standard non-barrel aged American pale ale like that.\\n\\n--COCKTAILS:  They have a good cocktail list and apparently a pretty diverse set of ingredients.  I ordered the Vieux Carre, a cocktail I had been looking for here for a while, but it unfortunately was underwhelming.  The flavors were off, fairly watered down...I think the server/bartender/everything else was harried, so I think it spent some time sitting in ice. I also think the vermouth was low quality...not the nice richness that helps balance this drink of say a carpano antica.  This cocktail is also made with 1.5 oz of liquor...for a drink with no mixer, that\\'s but one shot (and at $11).  Maybe that\\'s why they felt so compelled to water it down to make it look presentable in a glass.\\n\\nThe FOOD:  Very limited menu!  Just a few sandwiches...didn\\'t try.\\n\\nThe SERVICE:  Very good when it was available.  When we were there it was pretty full and it seemed like one guy was doing all the waitering, cocktail making, and beer pouring.  He was super friendly and knowledgeable when you had his attention, but we mostly didn\\'t have attention.\\n\\nOn the whole, this place is too expensive for what\\'s on offer.  Not going to rush back. Walked in to this bar by chance and was thoroughly impressed. Emily was a charming host and made me feel like this was my local pub. The cocktails were delicious and proportioned to maximize strength without compromising taste. 10/10 would try again. Came here on a Saturday night after dinner in ktown, which was just a short walk away. The place was fairly packed around 9pm and we got a seats at the bar, the atmosphere was great! I ordered a their cocktail special which was a \"punch\" with rum and spices and it was very good! They also have a good beer selection and drinks were reasonably prices. The place is a little small so the waitress would bump into me sometimes walking from the kitchen to the tables and there were limited number of hooks for your bag and coat but will definitely be coming back for drinks and checking out other restaurants in the area! Coffee was fine but waiters are slow and kind of too cool for school. Nice decor and selection though. Cute and cozy spot for beer, especially during the daily (!) happy hour.\\n\\nOne day when my beer bud and I were exploring that end of Bloor for the first time, we saw the sandwich board advertising $2 off any beer between 5 and 7. I made a mental note for us to come back. We\\'re glad we did - we love the vibe, the decor, the service. This isn\\'t a local for us, but we make a point of coming in for a pint when the location and timing works out. This is the first place we tried Kissmeyer on tap. A tad pricey during regular hours (we\\'ve found it for significantly less), but nice at $6.75 (before tip).\\n\\nThe place does fill up from 5 to 7, so be warned you might not find a table if you arrive too late or come with too many people. Some folks make this their coffee and laptop spot during the late afternoons and this spills over into happy hour. A lot of people are here for the cocktails, not the beer, so it\\'s fun to sit at the bar and watch the concoctioneering. Another amazing gem in the neighbourhood - excellent  coffee shop by day and bar by night. Northwood keeps us coming back for great coffee and superb cocktails. The music at night is just right. A new favourite, can\\'t wait to try one of their pop up dinners or brunch. I was here a few months ago for a co-worker\\'s birthday outing and I was pleasantly surprised that they also served coffee in the mornings.  I recognized one of the bartenders who was previously a barista at Lit Espresso Bar - Alex Castellani. Really cool guy.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m seldom out in these parts of the west end, but I really enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere they provided.  The cost for booze was moderately priced - a bit more than I\\'m comfortable with, so I usually stick to 2 cocktails max.  Anything after that is if I\\'m feeling splurgy (or want to get drunk).\\n\\nThey\\'ve got a decent selection of wines, craft beers, liquors and cocktails sourced from all over the world.  They\\'ve also got a decent patio too if you\\'re ever in the area and want to hit a patio to have to imbibe in their delicious libations.\\n\\nIf alcohol isn\\'t your thing, they also serve coffee as well, with expertly pulled espresso based drinks from their two group Synesso espresso machine. Nice place with a fantastic atmosphere, assuming you don\\'t mind the indifferent, hipster staff that work here (which in turn attracts a largely hipster crowd).  Drink selection is great though and worth a visit.\\n\\nPatio is being worked on now and should be open any day. Really enjoyed my time here on a Friday night. It was just busy enough and there was a great vibe inside, with a perfect soundtrack of old school hip-hop beats. I had the No. 9 (Dark as Night, Sweet as Sin -- $12) and the No. 8 (7 1/2 Floor -- $9) cocktails, and both were EXCELLENT. I was particularly fond of the No. 8, which was on the sweeter end as far as cocktails go, and went down nice and easy. There was also a late night snacks menu on offer, and although I didn\\'t have the chance to sample any of the food, I was intrigued by the options ranging from Agedashi Tofu to Beef Sam. \\n\\nHalf the place has more of a cafe feel, with a lovely exposed brick wall, and the bar side feels a little bit \"grungier\" and more industrial. Looking forward to returning again soon! Toronto gets it. At least its nightlife industry gets it. This is yet another golden lit, dark-walled, laid back, approachable bar that says, \\'hither, but where else is there the cackle of drunken kids, heartwarming thirtysomethings and comedic snarling trios of women along with shots of fernet, and a casual, open enough space for anyone who isn\\'t interested in drinking?\" \\n\\nIt could be the fact that I hail from the land of more bars per capita than most places but somehow most bars are packed, and I have the feeling I\\'ve seen it all... but, from an outsider\\'s perspective... the approachability of a bar is more important than anything else, and Northwood gets the point: there\\'s no fucking curtain, there\\'s no hostess ready to say no, and there\\'s no line. There are chairs outside in case you want to wait for a better seat... there\\'s standing room inside. There\\'s low tables, bench tables and a bar. Service was massively attentive and casual. Table service through the night with plenty of water top offs. \\n\\nAnd, with the fernet on the menu that can be slung back or taken a nip off of... this place is like an alternatively better version of many hideouts in SF. People in Canada are nicer. The drinks are cheaper. And there\\'s more leg room. I am far too old and grumpy to put up with wobbly chairs and tables, overpriced cocktails and a ridiculous menu. The staff seemed to hate their jobs while we were there. I get it. I have hated serving tables too. \\nI really think that this place is best for a burgeoning young relationship where you aren\\'t eating anyway and are trying to impress your date with how sophisticated you are. Great place for cocktails and drinks. They have an extensive menu for cocktails, beer, wine, and other liquors and everything I tried were satisfying. The food menu is very limited so would not suggest it if you are looking for a good/full dinner. The place is dim, not too noisy, and very relaxed. My favourite bar in our hood! So happy to have this place close to our home. Great craft beers as well as yummy fresh cocktails, and the snacks were great, too! The cocktails are $12-16 range, which is fair compared to other cocktail bars like this downtown. Oh, and great patio for the summer! YAY! Good atmosphere, good snacks, great alcohol list, and love that you can order non-alcoholic drinks into the wee night: lattes, hot chocolates etc. The atmosphere is what you pay for here. Cocktails will run you $12-15 and a beer on tap is about $7-10. The drinks are pretty good though and the wait staff is courteous and friendly. Sitting at the window bar was quite nice although the place got exceptionally loud on a Tuesday evening such that I was effectively yelling by the end of the night. Where\\'s Northwood, GPS?  Intersection of Plaid and Grads, with a side of Kimchi.\\n\\nI stumbled inside.  I stumbled to the back.  I stumbled downstairs.  \\n\\nBy the time my eye glasses cleared up I had landed, at the bottom.\\n\\nVintage and cosy warm, I must have slipped down a hippie rabbit hole in space/time.\\n\\nNo matter, I\\'m glad they had urinals instead of outhouses in this snow stormy weather.\\n\\nI pulled myself upstairs and saw a note. Beware: slippery stairs.  Wish I had read that.\\n\\nThis evening I sat at the bar listening to one of my all time favourites, Milk Frothing.\\n\\nI wish I had time for coffee but alas \\'twas a beer-crawl and I know my limitations.\\n\\nWhy not take a cold-brew (http://northwoodto.ca/cold-brew/) for later? Apologies, out-of-stock.\\n\\nWe sat, drank, chat like Canadians at a Canadian café/bar  The end. I was meeting two of my oldest friends here for a little catch-up session, and thought \"Hey, great idea: I\\'ll bike straight from work! It\\'s only Bay/Bloor to Christie Pits, that\\'s like 10 minutes. -15 is nothin\\'.\"\\n\\nIdiot. My hands froze solid. Halfway there I kicked my chain off completely, and had to do a sidewalk pit stop to get it back on. By the time I got there, my fingers were so numb, I couldn\\'t even get my bike lock undone. I rushed inside to defrost, and realized I couldn\\'t get my helmet off. So there I am inside Northwood, fully clad in coat, balaclava and helmet, blowing hot air into my hands and watching my bike suspiciously in case a lunatic impervious to the cold decided to run away with it...for 10 minutes!\\n\\nRelevance? The friendly bar staff made no jests at my expense. Thankfully. Though I felt shame. I finally de-iced, locked-up, my friends showed up smiling and eager for a few child-free hours (3 kids between the two of them.)\\n\\nWe were thrilled by the $2-Off-All-Beer deal between 5-7pm (every night!) and ordered some tall bottles of suds (I\\'m an 1850s prospector, consarn it.) I had a Garrisson IPA and a Chimay Blue. Both warmed me appropriately for the frosty trip home.\\n\\nWe also ordered some snacks! They suggested getting a few dishes, since the plates are small. This was true and good advice, but the beer was filling enough that I think we were satisfied. In any case, my Root Vegetable Winter Salad was phenomenal. Beets, carrots, rutabaga & radish, with goat cheese and sunflower seeds. My taste buds danced around the flavours like a Bill Cosby tapdance-off, and when it was over everybody won. I can\\'t wait to try and recreate it at home (The salad, not the tapdance competition. My neighbour already passive-aggressively bangs my walls to complain about the reasonable level my GF plays Sarah McLachlan, I don\\'t need the downstairs neighbours finding an excuse to poke at their ceiling with a Swiffer.)\\n\\nAnyway, it\\'s a great space, the cocktails are also good, and now that I know the food is good I\\'ll be coming back more often. Not in this weather though. A welcome addition to the bloor west hood. Impressive list of (bottled) beer and a few nice draughts. Wine list & cocktails are unique. Snacks are served (sandwiches and the like) and good coffee is part of the mantra. Possibly the best iced drip coffee i have ever tasted. No milk or sugar required! \\n\\nI like when cafes are true to their name: serving both caffeine and booze in true European fashion.\\n\\nThe patio is lovely, as is the interior. The bathrooms are spotless and have a cozy cottage-like charm. Thumbs up! I wish I owned some kind of share in this place that allowed me to always have a table here. \\n\\nLiving around the corner I\\'ve spent a few years finishing a bottle of wine with friends and facing the dark options of a Bloor West selection of bars whose zenith was Pour Boy\\'s (yeah there\\'s Piston or 3 Speed but..I dunno. We never jived.) \\n\\nNow instead of walking into decades of burps and sad old zoo cougars, we get to hop over to Northwood; fresh paint and friendship. \\n\\nIt\\'s a comfy and beautiful spot, and the drinks are priced up but not high (a single Fernet with lemon was $5.60, for example). \\n\\nDaytime: \\nMy boyfriend and I came in here for the first time mid-morning, and had really pleasant espressos looking out on Christie Pits in the sunny front window. \\n\\nCrowd:\\nI know it\\'s hard for some to hear, but \"hipsters\" are just people under 35 with a shred of whimsy. \\n\\nConclusion: The world is great and I love it. Took a half hour to be told that the \"snack\" I ordered was no longer available. Took another 15 minutes to be given something that looked like dog food and had a chefs hair in it! Yuck! Was sitting outside and the wood table was crawling with little tiny bugs :/ had to keep shooing them away with their menu! \\n\\nOther than that the drinks were food with good craft beer and wine selections. Had their Old Fashioned and the orange/ice was done right! Didn\\'t have a chance to try their food but the atmosphere inside looked perfect for a summer night. \\n\\nFriendly staff and very relaxing vibe. \\n\\nWill be back :) This place is a great addition to the neighborhood, which used to be a bit meh. Northwood is definitely not meh. The atmosphere is conducive to productive work during the day and the Cold Brew is really choice. Five stars to Brian who handled some really delicate customers last time I was in!\\n\\nNorthwood has delicious & amazing cocktails. I highly recommend the Lady Grey cocktail--complete with cracked black pepper. Also Beau\\'s Lug Tread on tap make it an even better local watering hole. \\n\\nGo here, it\\'s just what you needed. Definitely one of the best cocktail bars and cafes in town. If you are looking for a place to have a great drink and great conversation, don\\'t miss out on Northwood \\nMy personal favourite is their cocktails with coffee in them. You can have it in the late afternoon and get re-energized.\\nIf you are looking for food, this is not the place to go for. Snacks are good but not food food. Very nice coffee place. Great oatmeal raisin cookies There are already too many photos here of cocktails rested near laptops, so I\\'ll spare you. What I love most about Northwood is that it\\'s a daytime cafe that smoothly transitions into a bar.  So if you want to come here around, say, 2pm, and work away on your laptop with, say, a cocktail instead of a coffee (or a cocktail *with* coffee in it), who\\'s to judge... \\nThe place is clearly designed for the academic and creative-industry crowd, who make up the majority of its patrons. They have a wicked cocktail menu and a great atmosphere -- that rare balance between casual and classy, with an expected hipster crowd but no obnoxious behaviour. The staff are attentive but not intrusive. I come here at least once a week to catch up with a friend or to write on my own while sipping a drink. It\\'s my favourite bar, and I don\\'t even live near its neighbourhood.\\n\\nThe LADY GREY SOUR cocktail is probably their signature drink, is excellent, and is exactly as it\\'s described. But my favourite is STORM BREWING, which is a twist on the classic Dark & Stormy with a clever addition of their in-house cold brew coffee. This drink is definitely not for everyone, but it\\'s layered and unexpected in all the right ways. When their experienced bartender(s) make it, it\\'s brilliant. However, they seem to have a fairly steady bartender turnover, and many of their secondary bartenders make a poor and disappointing version (either far too sour or using flattened ginger beer). If you\\'re really feeling adventurous, try the Black Lodge cocktail, but for me the combination of tequila, cold brew, agave sweetness, and egg white proteins is all wrong and totally undrinkable. They had some other amazing cocktails in the winter, and I\\'m looking forward to them switching the menu up again.\\n\\nSo, if I can\\'t stop coming to this awesome bar, why only 4 stars?\\nFirst: the uneven drink preparation. I never thought much about the importance of \"mixology\" until coming here over the course of 8+ months and noting the really wide variety of quality in the drinks. For instance, in the winter, I used to order the Vieux Carre cocktail, which is difficult to balance well and *demands* top-notch ingredients. When one of the owners (or whom I imagine to be a key bartender, at the least) makes it, he takes great care and tries the drink, sometimes adjusting to get it right. The last time I attempted to order it, with a different bartender, it tasted way off and the rye whiskey itself was poor quality. When I mentioned to the bartender that it doesn\\'t balance as well as always, she gave me a puzzled expression and said \"but it\\'s such an easy one, I just poured whatever it said in the recipe.\" [easy one? it has 6 components...] \\nI realize I might be more picky than most, but a great cocktail menu (at great-cocktail prices, no less) deserves better.\\n\\nSecond, the food here is not good, at all. I think they\\'re still trying to work out their kitchen, and I get the sense that the owners\\' heart isn\\'t in the culinary side as much as the beverages. \\nDon\\'t come here hungry and don\\'t plan to eat. \\nIt\\'s a cafe/bar and it\\'s totally amazing at doing just that. Oh boy... I\\'m not happy writing this. Service here is how I expect war criminals to be served in heaven. (Ignored, awful) \\nI have been here around 20 times and around the last ten have been some of the laziest instances of service. Don\\'t you want to come to my table and take more drink orders?? Don\\'t you want to make money?? Sitting half an hour without a drink order on a table and no water glasses is insane and I am embarrassed to stay I stayed. \\nIt is never very busy when I come. And having to beg for the bill only to see the bartender start cleaning tables after saying \"yes\" is creepy. It\\'s also creepy when they only pay attention to you when they want your money. This happens all the time. Once the bill is down they\\'re like vultures. \\nGood luck on the patio in the summer as you could be having a heart attack and none of the staff would notice. They would probably start cleaning tables around your dying body. Really wished this place was around when I worked in the Bloor & Shaw area. The last time I walked by this location it was a questionable Chinese restaurant. I couldn\\'t help but notice there\\'s something much better going on when I strolled by the other day.\\n\\nI could sense it was a coffee shop when I walked in based on the amount of people clicking away on their laptops. I figured I would rest my feet at the bar and have my fourth cup of coffee that day. I looked around to see if there was a menu and grabbed their clipboard -- it listed all the fancy coffees they make, but thankfully they had three edible options at the bottom. I opted for the ham & swiss sandwich.\\n\\nAmericano was good. Girl working there was friendly, and the decor was quite nice. It\\'s not a unique experience with lots of wood & black paint (similar to Beaconsfield or Churchill) but I appreciated the effort in making the place comfortable. Quite a bit of time passed since I finished my drink and I was wondering if my sandwich was coming or not. I was actually about to pack up and forget about it, but then a dude finally came with what turned out to be a rather delicious hot snack. Maybe not worth the six-plus dollars it cost (though it came with grapefruit which I skipped) but I was still satisfied.\\n\\nWould really like to see some more snacks. Even maybe just some baked goods like muffins or cookies. I realise it\\'s also probably a rocking bar at night, but if it\\'s going to do the coffee shop vibe in the morning/afternoon I would like to have a little more variety. I would have killed for some soup. I stopped in here with a friend for a drink in between other stops on our route on a Friday night. Obviously with such great reviews, we were looking forward to coming to Northwood.\\n\\nWe walked in and it was very dark inside. No problem though, it was nighttime and it\\'s a bar so the lighting was acceptable. Actually, this would be a GREAT place to bring someone when you\\'re either not looking so hot or the person you\\'re with isn\\'t looking so hot!\\n\\nAnyway... The place was full when we walked in. All tables and bar stools were occupied but the guy behind the bar motioned to an empty table at the back and so we sat there. \\n\\nA server came to our table promptly with a menu. When she returned to take our order, my friend was in the washroom. I ordered a dubbel ($9) (so glad this beer is so often on drink menus now), and I told the server that my friend would order when she returned to her seat.\\n\\nOur server brought my drink along with a bottle of water and two glasses. My friend was still checking the menu.\\n\\nThe server never returned... NEVER. \\n\\nI finished my beer and she hadn\\'t even come by again ONCE!\\n\\nWe decided that since the service sucked we\\'d be on our way. I put $12 (a 10 and a twoonie) on the table to cover my beer+tax+tip. After we were walking down the street, my friend handed me the twoonie I had left. She said she took it because the server didn\\'t deserve it. I actually felt pretty bad because that meant I was actually 17 cents short on the actual bill with tax. I was then a little embarrassed that I ended up being short, but whatever.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m sure this place is great with a different server. I\\'d totally come back, pay my amount owing from my first visit and leave an appropriate tip on whatever I had during my return. (I just wouldn\\'t bring a friend who might reclaim my tip money!)\\n\\nEven though the place was busy, the crowd was a little tame. Everyone was seated so my first impression was that this is more of a date place. (Actually, as far as ambiance, it reminded me a bit of Bar Volo).\\n\\nSo yeah, the poor rating is really just based on the service, which was as I mentioned: non-existent.\\n\\nThat said, I totally want to go back.\\n\\nAnd if anyone from Northwood is reading this... I\\'m seriously really sorry about being 17-cents short! (Not so sorry my friend scammed the tip as it wasn\\'t really deserved anyway). Thanks to my DT-TO partner in crime Evelyn W for bringing me to her secret happy place where good things come in a cup all day long. She invited me here on a GTA/TO work day and said this was the place to be for Coffee, Cocktails and WiFi.\\n\\nI arrived a tad early and got a chance to scope out the joint for myself and was really impressed with the caged in bar, uber clean basement bathrooms and the espresso machines spoutin\\' steam ready to whip up my order. Even got a few moments alone with the morning barista before the crowds flocked in, she was very knowledgeable about her bean and made me a stellar Americano that kept the fire going most of the morning!\\n\\nAfter taking a brief break for lunch, we returned and I sat with a great cup of tea while I did my afternoon work. Upon our afternoon return Northwood was bustling with would be bloggers, next-gen work from hom-ers and various other Apple computer users. One item of note that as the body count rises in here, so to does the temperature and before long I was stripped down to my undershirt and jeans. So ensure you layer even in the dead of winter.\\n\\nWhile the preceding Americano and Tea were essential parts of my functioning day, the part I enjoyed the most was my end of day cocktail. A real treat lay in store for me as I let the staff choose my poison for me and I was blessed to be granted the opportunity to sip on their Smoked Old Fashioned done with maple syrup...\\n\\nSo many Canadian flavours in my mouth at one time!!! I felt like was wearing flannel and a toque (I probably was), while sitting in a Quebec sugar shack, dining on Moose Meat and duck while watching Hockey Night In Canada. Yes! All that came to me whilst sippin\\' on this sweet-n-smokey delight! Would move to the neighborhood just to visit Northwood more often. \\n\\nThe experience at Northwood is special, from the music to the staff and (most importantly) the drinks. It\\'s the perfect spot for date night drinks, or catching up with a small group of friends. \\n\\nI can\\'t think of anywhere else in Toronto that you get 2-2.5 oz cocktails for such reasonable prices ($11-14 for most), and they are some of the best drinks you\\'ll have in the city. My boyfriend and I went recently and each had 3 cocktails, each better than the last. Our favorites were La Commune and Black Walnut.\\n\\nThe bartender we had last time was fantastic. She managed to get cocktails out to 30 people quickly, was able to answer questions about the drinks, and was really friendly. \\n\\nCan\\'t wait to go back. So happy to have a new coffee shop in this area!! Especially since some around here are not as good... \\n\\nI love the atmosphere and the server was so friendly and helpful. \\n\\nI got a brownie with caramel and salt it was sooo good and the tea they serve is from tealish so it was also tasty. \\n\\nI love that it\\'s a coffee shop and a bar and stays open until 2am!! I mean really what more could you ask for. It really has it all. \\n\\nThe only issue I would say is that some of the chairs don\\'t have backs to them which can be annoying if you go to do work. They do have some chairs with backs but just be aware! I love sitting here in the afternoon to work. The interior is so nice, the coffee is good and it\\'s possibly my favourite local chill out place. Admittedly I haven\\'t been here in the evening for drinks yet but the cocktail menu looks smashing.\\n\\nOne year later... I love this place even more. I spent the better part of a day at Northwood and enjoyed it so much I wasn\\'t even tired of being there at the end of it all. The atmosphere is great for working during the day and socializing during the evening. Seriously, this cafe covers it all.\\n\\nAn added bonus of being there so long means that I experienced a lot of what they have to offer, and from lattes to sparkling wine at happy hour, to cheese plates, everything I had I liked.\\n\\nThe menus are small, but creative and the staff is efficiently friendly. It would be one of my main hangs if I lived in Toronto. Nice little bar with atmoshere and good selection of drinks, including some beers on tap. Little because seating might be limited, but patio in summer time is rather large. People are friendly. I dig Northwood.\\n\\nIt\\'s the perfect spot along the Bloor strip if you\\'re not in the mood for a dive pub or sports bar. It\\'s casual/classy, with a relaxed vibe that still feels special. I like how dimly lit it it.\\n\\nThe cocktails and beer selection are awesome, though I will say slightly overpriced (hence the 4 stars).\\n\\nOverall a great place to hang, whether stopping in for a casual drink or going on a date. Northwood is a gem. The drinks are fun, the atmosphere is cozy and the rotating list of food is always interesting. Plus, the fact that it serves tasty coffee and snacks during the day is just great.\\n\\nOnly disappointments: it tends to get packed with hipsters later in the night, and the NYE dinner was overpriced and not at all memorable. I think the quality of the food really depends on who\\'s cooking/catering, and the staff seem much more used to bar tending than serving tables. But all in all, I really like this place! This is a great new addition to the neighbourhood -  I haven\\'t been during the day for coffee etc, but I\\'m in love with the atmosphere and coming here mostly at night. Have been here a few times always with great service, amazing cocktails and is now my new fav place for Buck-a-Shuck oyster nights on Wednesdays. Make sure to get there early though after 6 because it fills up! Had a small birthday gathering here and had no issues by calling a week in advance! Nice little bar in the Bloor/Ossington \\'hood. Had a few delicious cocktails made by a very attentive lady bartender. Came for a food pop-up & enjoyed everything on the menu! I love this place but they\\'re a tad overpriced. I find myself only ever going between 5-7 when it is $2 off draught. Went here for brunch yesterday.\\n\\nBavette steak was satisfying, and precisely medium-rare, as requested.\\n\\nVeal poutine had \"home fries\"-style pieces of potato, rather than (long, thin) french fries (which was not explicit on the menu).  This cuts down on the surface area and is sub-optimal for poutine.  It also did not have quite enough cheese, nor quite enough gravy. The veal itself was moist and tender, which, for the most part, redeemed the dish.\\n\\nPork and beef tourtiere was great (if you\\'re into that sort of thing).  The pastry was crisp and flaky, the interior was lightly spiced, saucy, and flavorful.  There was a bit of apple sauce on the plate which provided some great complimentary sweetness and tartness.\\n\\nStack-o-flapjacks was a gratifying way to spike my blood sugar, and the bourbon maple syrup was a nice touch. I was quite impressed with the variety of cocktails Northwood had in their menu. Since I like bourbon and cognac, I finally settled for the Tiki Old Fashioned (yes that\\'s what it was called). It had that blended deepness of cognac with a citrus finish. Definitely a drink only for those that like hard liquor. I\\'m glad that the bartender was nice enough to describe  the differences and particulars about each drink as I doubt any first timers like myself would know which cocktail to best order. \\n\\nMeanwhile, my friends also enjoyed there drinks but I don\\'t remember the drink names (see pics for parts of their drink menu). \\n\\nNorthwood is a cozy and chill bar to try unique cocktails and catch up with friends. Try to go earlier as I heard that it can get really packed by late evening. Cheers! Overall not worth it. I did enjoy the environment and set-up but menu was disappointing. For an appetizer I did order hummus and what I got in return was a few dozen seasoned garbanzo beans. And the chai latte was bland, it couldn\\'t even wash out the bad taste in my mouth. So my last update was a little off. They have stopped with the oysters, and the patio isn\\'t in full swing, but...\\n\\nThey have done some pop-up menus with varying chefs, but it looks like they\\'ve got some keepers for supper hour and they aren\\'t messing around. Get some of their delish delights (think: tortiere, pea soup with biscuits and braised beef poutine) to go with your craft cocktails and reasonably priced wine and beer. Mmm K? I came twice here and both times was turned away because they were at capacity. \\n\\nThe first time I left my number and was texted back 1.5 hours later. It seems unbelievable that the next available seat needed a 1.5 hour wait. \\n\\nThe second time there was clearly a woman at the bar leaving and an empty stool next to her but I still received the same response. I told the host not to bother taking my number.\\n\\nMaybe I don\\'t fit the clientele or the host didn\\'t want to bother serving me... the drinks were good in the past but I couldn\\'t care for the host. Dinner service. Patio. Music. New website. Northwood, you go girl! I love the ambiance at this place. The staff is extremely nice and they serve really good cocktails. My favourite being the Choupette, its delicious.\\n\\nMr. H and I go quite often and even took our friends from the US, everyone loved the place. We once had to wait a long time before a table was available, there was one empty table but the customers were out smoking (for like an hour!) and the waitress was getting annoyed too. She said she would ask them to leave once they came back and move us over and she made sure to follow through.\\n\\nThe later in the night it gets to louder the place gets too so keep that in mind, the place does however have a relaxed vibe and fun to visit with friends.\\n\\n(Ps: i have only been here late nights) Amazing staff, owner is awesome. If you call a tab a \"tap\" I probably won\\'t trust your review haha. Also if this guy hated the beans why did he ordered more bread? Such weird reviews for this place. Snacks are always great and it fills a hole in the neighborhood for a predrink spot!!!! Really loved this warm, friendly spot on Bloor near Christie Pits Park.\\n\\nI came here with friends on a warm summer evening. By 8 p.m. the patio was full, but there were plenty of seats inside.\\n\\nWe stayed through the evening enjoying beers and conversation. The place got full, but never terribly crowded. Inside the decor and ambiance are tasteful and inviting.\\n\\nThe staff here are friendly and knowledgeable. They have an extensive selection of draught and bottled beers. I also hear that they do amazing cocktails. Maybe next time! Northwood is definitely worth a return visit. Super hipster crowd here. Gotta love the exposed brick and wooden seating. Drink deals Are not the greatest but alright. I like the variety of light fixtures and cozy setup . Not much for appetizer situation. They cannot split bills, only offer cash machine that\\'ll charge you. Great little bar with a cozy vibe. Came in on a snowy night to find to my delight that they serve 1/2 priced wine on Wednesday nights. That\\'s a drink special I can get into. Sign me up for a glass for Sibling Rivalry for $4.5! I\\'ll be back to give this place another try. Really great bar with a cool atmosphere and drinks to match. Always a really good atmosphere here at the weekends. The bartenders are great for helping with recommendations. It\\'s very cosy and intimate. I lived right beside this bar in Toronto so I went all the time and now I can\\'t wait to return. Meh. My friends were really excited to go to this place, as they had been previously and had really enjoyed themselves. Given the variety of bars in Toronto, this spot is a total take it or leave it. We were a reasonably large group and the servers didn\\'t seem particularly interested in accommodating us even though there was a lot of space available when we arrived (and a reservation had been made) Overall, service was spotty and we were ignored after being there for awhile. Drinks were of average quality and very overpriced. I had a panini that was a bit soggy, chewy, and cold. Probably fine for one drink if you\\'re alone or on a date. Didn\\'t eat here, but the drinks & service were outstanding on a busy Saturday night for a very large group. They were attentive, personable and spot on. Great vibe. Highly recommended. Sick atmosphere and sexy chemists synthesizing seductive solutions. Bar Crawl #1:  Beau\\'s Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale & St Bernardus Abt 12\\n\\nHappy Hour Everyday till 7 pm! $2 off drafts and bottles/cans. Sweet!\\n\\nOf course I have to start off with a pint: Beau\\'s Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale ($5.50 with HH specials!) and my Yelp friend with a can of Howe Sound Lager ($4.5 with HH Special). And of course if you prefer some exquisite import: A bottle of St Bernardus Abt 12 ($28).\\n\\nThe interior is dark, dim and cozy. I like how Northwood is a coffee/beer/cocktail drinking place as that means I can hang out here the whole day. \\n\\nToo bad they were out of the 8oz Cold Brew to go. I guess I have to come back soon to try out their cocktails and coffee! And free WIFI!! Oh that means I can even yelp a bit! Been here many times, it\\'s always great! Amazing beer selection. Perfect date or just casual place. No pretentiousness, friendly service. Do you like being charged three times for one drink? Do you like snooty little witch waitresses in too-tight denim hipster shorts who can\\'t add? Do you like waiters who disappear for hours at a time while glasses pile up on dirty tables? Do you like it when 25-year-olds roll their eyes at you unstoppably, as if they don\\'t understand that you are customers, they are waiters, and it\\'s their actual job to bring the drink you ordered an hour ago? WELL, IF YOU DO, THEN NORTHWOOD IS FOR YOU.\\n\\nI\\'ll never go back. Paid three times for the same shitty beers just to avoid a fight when my bill was wrong several times over. Service horrendous. Staff utterly incompetent.\\n\\nI cannot understand all these positive reviews. I haven\\'t has such a bad experience in Toronto in years. Fun and creative drink selection, including retro-style drinks. Lady Grey cocktail was very good. Nice ambiance! Went here last night to do the whole online-to-real life transition with somebody from eharmony.\\n\\nWith a few of these sorts of meetings in my world these day, it seems like I\\'m really getting to know impressive places in the city to drink cocktails.  Northwood is another winner.\\n\\nWe sat outside on their terrific patio.  Service was excellent.\\n\\n(Absolutely love it when a host and/or wait staff are observant enough to know when a table of two is a first date and then make extra effort to ensure a good/smooth time!  This has happened a couple of times and it always means an extra tip--many, many thanks!)\\n\\nThe interior, from what I saw, is great--seems like this place will really work in the colder months too.\\n\\nThe cocktail list has about 10 interesting items and I\\'m sure the staff can make anything under the sun.  I went with their gin and tonic.  It was a well crafted, well presented G&T but quite honestly not something I\\'d order again.  I prefer mine to be a bit more crisp and carbonated...maybe I\\'m just too used to what I made at home.  \\n\\nNext up was their Paper Moon which I liked better--gin based, it is very sweet and delicious.  It also has a bunch of booze in it that most people do not stock at home.\\n\\nMy date enjoyed her \"Faith & Fortune\".\\n\\nWe also got the nibbly snack basket thing.  \\n\\nNorthwood is a great place to enjoy a drink--and a huge improvement over that old Chinese food place.  Recommended--especially for first dates! cozy, dim.  too dim?\\nbooze bottles caged at the bar\\nboth brick and black walls\\n\\nstaff is attentive\\nfriendly and hospitable\\njust A+ service\\n\\nextensive beer list\\nmostly bottles, a few taps\\nmany cocktails too\\n\\nsandwiches, snacks, sweets\\nall of which i\\'ve never tried\\ni just go for drinks\\n\\nsipping on cold brew\\ni could spend all evening here\\none of my go-to\\'s GO HERE for cocktails. The list is super long, and the staff is very helpful. The ambience is cute & cozy. Great for week-night cocktails after work.\\n\\nThe food / snacks are OK. I\\'m a vegetarian and have ordered the white bean dip. The dip is really smooth with a great crunch on top with the addition of various seeds. The dipping vessel it comes with is a thin, gluten free crepe-ish bread which was also delicious. My friends and I happened to stumbled on this gem a couple of months ago on a Wednesday night.  A deal was on for a buck oysters and half price wine and we took them up on the offer.  It turned out to be a great decision.  The oyster was fresh, the wine was chilled and the server was nice.  We\\'ve since become regulars. Our server at the Crafty Coyote recommended Northwood to us. I had two cocktails - a Hot Toddy and a Violet Hour cocktail. The Violet Hour was the best tequila cocktail I have ever had. There were many cocktails to choose from and will definitely be back again for more. This is probably my favorite place to drink/sit/frig around on a laptop/watch people/get drunk at. It\\'s very versatile. \\n\\nOpens at 10am, have some Pig Iron Coffee (get that stuff at Lit Espresso Bar, too), sit and watch Christie Pitts park, get a sandwich, switch to bourbon, see who goes in and out of Toronto BJJ across the street, order more bourbon, and repeat. \\n\\nTheir cocktail menu is very impressive...not huge but the drinks on it are all delicious. I sort of regret writing this review because I don\\'t want YOU sitting in my spot next time I go in. Yelp piggy backin\\', bastards. Not your everyday \"mix a drink from a cocktail book\" place. They have their own creations like black walnut cocktail. Try this little gem! A-OK in my books. \\n\\nDRINKS:\\nThis is a great place for drinks, but wine wasn\\'t half price on a Wednesday (boo). There was a promotion for cocktails but we are wine drinkers.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nVery limited snack/food selection, all bread based. Cheese platter was good, pickled bow was good, pork spread was meh. Each one came with a lot of freshly toasted baguette bread, which is a nice touch but ... so much bread. \\n\\nAMBIANCE:\\nA+! Great decor, it was full but still not too crazy noisy. We sat at the bar and finished at a table. Lighting not too dark - not too bright. Stylish. \\n\\nThis is an A-OK place to have a drink near Christie Pits. But I wouldn\\'t stretch to 4 stars because of cost and (to me) dissatisfying snack choice. Northwood has been on my list of places to check out for some time now and so glad that I was in Koreatown so that I could drop by.  The drink menu is bigger than the food menu - my kind of place.  Between the selection of classic cocktails, original cocktails, sours & smashes and coffee-based drinks, I was in lush heaven. The drinks are boozy but delicious.  I really enjoyed the twists on the classic cocktails.  Can\\'t complain about about the price either - $14 a pop is a steal.  I highly recommend the papermoon as a shot choice (can be served as a cocktail as well).\\n\\nCute patio too.  Will definitely return. A nice little place.  I\\'ve only grabbed a drink here with a friend but I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place and the beer suggestion was on point by the waitress.  Large drinks menu with lots of different liquors, beers, wines, and some mixed cocktails.  I will definitely go again and try some of the food next time.  Only problem is that it became a little crowded and loud, understandable since it was a Saturday night and the place is new so there\\'s some buzz around it but we had to leave since we couldn\\'t hear each other talk.'],\n",

       "  'Quelle joie d\\'avoir découvert ce restaurant. Il est à une minute à pied du bord de l\\'eau, assez spacieux et confortable ce restaurant est une merveille. La carte est très généreuse, le service fut efficace et ceci n\\'est pas un détail les plats étaient excellents. Le poisson était fondant en bouche. \\nPour finir les prix sont tout à fait correct. Le tout etait très honnête.\\nJ\\'allais oublier, dans ce restaurant il y a des box de\\nBois avec des banquettes à l\\'intérieur. On peut les fermer avec des drapées pour plus d\\'intimité. Cela a beaucoup amusé mes filles :) bref pittoresque en plus. Been here twice -- one time for dinner at the sushi bar and the second time for take out and both has been a very mediocre experience.\\nThe location is good, near the Harbourfront and the Music Garden and marina, surrounded by tons of condo developments. It\\'s the only restaurant west of Spadina near the Harbourfront, which is too bad as this area really needs more quality restaurants. I live just a block away.\\n\\nMy dinner there just okay. The service was prompt and courteous. The on-the-house amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a bit of a joke: a deep fried piece of maki, over-fried to the point where it was hard to tell what it was.  I had an horrifying thought that it must have been a left over piece of sushi that was battered and deep fried. The second amuse was a simple spoonful of soba in a soy mushroom broth -- not bad. I could do without these complementary offerings.\\n\\nThe restaurnant is run by Koreans which explains for the Korean dishes on the menu. I didn\\'t feel like having Korean food and had an assortment of sushi, maki and sashimi instead. The quality was generally okay in terms of freshness and quality of cuts. The sushi rice was at least properly seasoned (though a bit on the light side) which is key starting point to a good sushi, the cut of fish is ample, however I\\'ve found the quality of the cuts of some of their raw fish to be rather poor. Their hamachi doesn\\'t seem to be actually hamachi and I found their \"hamachi\" along with their other white fish to be rather tough and stringy which is a sign that you are not getting a quality cut of sushi-grade fish. I had to spit out a couple pieces into my napkin because it was way too stringy.\\nThe two sushi chefs at the bar were polite, but very quiet and not as social as your typical Japanese sushi chefs -- they seemed to be more fixated on the Just for Laughs Gags that was annoyingly playing on their large flatscreen TV.  The surface of the bar was a bit on the sticky side (just like another reviewer\\'s comments on the dining tables) and so was their plastic covered menus. It was a little off putting.\\nThe cost of the dinner was very pricey considering the second rate quality and cuts of the fish.\\n\\nI decided to give Guirei another chance by ordering takeout for dinner. Unfortunately the whitefish/hamachi sushi and sashimi pieces were still tough and stringy (I only ate one piece and spat or threw out the rest) along with a few pieces of tuna. The wakame salad was good, though the portion was rather small and it seems like they didn\\'t have any leak-proof containers for it as the dressing leaked out of it (at least they did put it in a separate plastic bag that was tightly tied closed).\\n\\nNext time I will definitely go to Ichiban Fish further east on Queen\\'s Quay. The quality and taste of their sushi and other dishes are much better than Geirei, and never disappoints, and is cheaper as well. The sushi here is pretty good. I\\'ve gone over lunch time with my colleagues since it\\'s near our office. The problem is that they\\'re slow as molasses. You can expect a work lunch to run almost 2 hours even if the restaurant is reasonably empty. Not the best. Not impressed with this place at all!\\n\\nI\\'ve eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it\\'s almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  The maki\\'s and hand rolls are never spectacular.   \\nAnd you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it\\'s pricey for what you\\'re getting.  I would pass on this one. I got the chicken Katsu tonight and it was horrible the rice when I opened it looked half eaten and also found a hair in it and it was cold. Maybe they didn\\'t like me and gave me someone\\'s left overs. It came with 2 thin chicken cutlets, 1 was good the other awful. Chicken had weird texture when biting into it like... Rubbery carrot... Not impressed did not eat even 1/3 of my meal. $15.58 a bit pricey especially for rice from a trash bin & mutant, freezer burned expired chicken. \\n\\nHungry buyer beware, maybe disappointed. For take out*\\nSorry Guirei but I was not impressed.\\nThis place looks well past its sell by date; the kitchen viewed from the delivery area has a real unclean feel to it. This was probably the worst sushi I have ever had. The gyoza was dried-out and basically inedible. The sashimi sliced far too thickly. The sushi pizza was also v poor. And $65 for 2 peeps, never again. There\\'s not many restaurant options in this part of town. I heard good reviews from people that live in the area, that is was reasonably priced and decent quality sushi. \\n\\nFrom the outside, Guirei doesn\\'t look too exciting. There is patio which was closed given the cold weather. But don\\'t judge a book by its cover, Guirei offered a cozy dining experience inside, with low lighting against dark furniture. As well, the windows are big so you get a nice view of the street/\\n\\nWe started off with warm sake-an excellent beginning on a cold and rainy evening! Service was fast and attentive. We ordered shortly and our food arrived within...5-10 minutes.\\n\\nThey did start the meal with an amuse bouche---fried sushi? lol tasted good. This was followed by a bowl of soup with thin noodles, not sure what exactly it was called, but tasted yummy.\\n\\nI had the dragon roll-on the sushi quality scale, I would say it was above sushi on bloor, but not at the level of a high end sushi place. The fish selection was fresh tasting. I really enjoyed it. My friend had the dinner special with teriakyi salmon. It was a large serving size, he could barely finish it! He enjoyed his meal and agreed the quality level was above average.\\n\\nAll in all, a good dining experience. The food was affordably priced. The ambience itself was relaxed. I would say the tables were half filled, and this was on a weekday evening.\\n\\nI would return to Guirei again for lunch or dinner. Definitely a go to place for waterfront locals :) Had the lunch specials,, found both the bento box and sushi to be below average. Wasn\\'t a bad price for lunch but was not satisfied. It was decent portions though. Would not go out of my way for this place Service is bad. The guys cheer you at the entrance only to forget about your existence second after. When you finally call them and ask to do their job, they look very busy, even with the place almost empty.\\n\\nOnce we\\'ve arrived there 10 minutes before the lunch time end, and were denied the lunch menu nevertheless. The server haven\\'t change her mind even after politely pointing out that we still have some time before the deadline.\\n\\nPlace is not that awfully dirty, but quite \"used\", not maintained well. You can actually stick to the table if you are lucky to get the one greasy enough.\\n\\nFood itself is just \"ok\" for the price. It is difficult to find decent sushi in Toronto, and Guirei is definitely not an impressive spot menu-wise. Nothing really bad, neither anything to dream about.\\n\\nThere is also a government housing next block, which is not fun to have around while waiting for a streetcar, or getting out of the parking to the normally packed Lakeshore West. PROS: A nice quiet spot on the waterfront, including a patio out front. Good sushi/sashimi plus other items (like Bibimbap). CONS: The interior could use a fresh color/coat of paint, and staff must do a better job of providing the bill in a timely manner; often times I have to go find a sever in order to pay the bill! Ate here again last night and I just have to say I am so lucky to live a five minute walk from this hidden gem. \\n\\nI eat a lot of sushi, and this place is pure quality. Beautiful presentation, fresh fish, perfect portion sizes. \\n\\nJust such a cute little place too. Very unassuming staff who always thank you when you leave... Or at least they do to me... Maybe because I go so often. \\n\\nThis is not a premium, high class restaurant people. But if you want amazing sushi, you will not be disappointed. Decor, atmosphere is average.  Food is good, with a very average/fair pricing, comparable to many other sushi joints.  I get take out when I am too lazy to travel farther for better or cheaper sushi joints.  Service is OK, turnover of servers is high, so service is something that will be a hit or miss.  Guirei is average at best. A nice little Japanese restaurant on the Queens Quay, this is one of my wife\\'s favourite non AYCE. A typical Japanese restaurant in terms of decor and food selection. My wife thoroughly enjoys the place because she finds the sushi to be very fresh tasting, and is one of the few places that actually offers a whole soft shell crab as a dish which she absolutely loves. I wanted to try this place as I live close-by, it failed on service, food, ambience, pretty much everything. Place was not busy, we were the only 2 people in the dining room, and there were a few people on the patio. Service was non existent, just took our orders, dropped off the food, didn\\'t ask if everything was ok, did not refill our (lukewarm) tea.\\n\\nOrdered the LA Ribs, they were ok, nothing special. The accompanying rice was cold and hard, the miso soup also lukewarm and overly salty. Also ordered the lobster roll and dragon roll with salmon. Worst rolls I\\'ve ever had, rolled so loosely that they fell apart right when we lifted them off the plate. Tiny slivers of fish and just a terrible presentation.\\n\\nCleanliness is terrible, the soy sauce container was filthy, and the sauce was black for some reason, probably a combination of being dirty and refilled too many times. Also an \"old\" dirty smell in the dining room, with flies buzzing around everywhere. Just an absolutely horrible dining experience. Been here many times. Great lunch specials. Big portions (especially the Bento boxes). Great selection of sushi and Korean food. Everything I\\'ve had has been tasty and well presented. I ordered take out here last week.  Sub-par sushi in all aspects.  There are way to many affordable and good sushi restaurants in this city to even justify eating here.  I live close by and thought I might as well try it, wish I didn\\'t.  My neighbourhood is lacking good take out sushi!! more expensive than places like sushi on bloor but better quality than sushi on bloor.  a decent selection of korean and japanese dishes.\\n\\nservice is spotty and not overly fast.  seems to be a lot of turnover.\\n\\nif it\\'s a warm summer\\'s day, the patio is amazing.  definitely 5 stars then. Quite happy to find this place around the corner from  Billy Bishop airport.  I had the deluxe bento box.  Was nothing spectacular but it was good and very reasonably priced.  Service lacked for what was a very slow day.  I think some of that was lack of english fluency so I\\'ll let it pass. \\n\\nI was happy with the food, seemed fresh and it was reasonably priced.  I suspect it will be my supper location before flights in the future. Love this place. It\\'s hard to find a sushi place that is good every time you go. This place is consistently good. Fresh, delicious rolls every single time. Highly recommended. My favourite Japanese restaurant. The menu may appear pricey at first, but you get a LOT of food for your money. I\\'m not a sushi fan, but friends I\\'ve taken here tell me it\\'s great. My favourite is the chicken teriyaki, which comes with rice and miso soup. Tempura and gyoza appetizers are also delicious, and my dad loves the green salad with apple, avacado, and house dressing. Very popular with locals, family atmosphere. Private booths, take-out, delivery, patio, valet parking. It doesn\\'t get any better than this. Pricey but not prohibitive, Guirei gets my vote for prompt, polite, and accommodating customer service (if not the most generous of sushi servings). Given a choice between another neighbourhood sushi restaurant, Mi-Ne on Bremner, I\\'d go here, for the superior customer service alone.  At Guirei, you can customize your roll with extra charges but no fuss and no attitude. Plus, Ikura is on the menu, which is key for Ikura fans.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Uni filled Viagra roll twice and ordered Uni sushi, Ikura,Tobiko sushi, Unagi, salmon sashimi, miso soup as well as the Alaska roll: all served fresh, all delicious. The miso soup was served hot, the fish was fresh, and our meal delivered without a glitch. Out of 3 visits, I have had 3 positive dining experiences at this location.\\n\\n\\nOur waitress was very attentive, refilling our tea and water promptly, and easily accommodating our request to have the Uni served separately (boyfriend is allergic to shellfish). We were seated promptly and served with equal speed. \\n\\nNote to large groups: dinner time seems to be especially busy for this location, and in my recent experience, it has been filled with groups of customers around 7.30pm: make a reservation. \\n\\nSo why the 3 stars? The sushi servings, while fresh, are smaller in size, comparatively speaking. And the prices, in direct comparison to Gonoe Japanese restaurant (located on the Queen\\'s Quay) is more expensive, sometimes by a dollar per order. However, the quality of the fish is high, and I have eaten well on every visit. \\n\\nIn a pinch, this place delivers a good meal, in a convenient location. My vote: Ikura Girl approved. I live in the states and we simply do not have sushi pizza but this place has it and it is to die for.  Love the location and everything i have had there is fantastic. Casual and wonderful.  They have a patio where you can sit out and look at the water.  I truly go out of my way to to to this place. What\\'s with the hate, guys?\\n\\nI mean granted I wouldn\\'t really come here for dinner and I do live a block away, but I really do think that their lunch specials are pretty great. I\\'ve tried the LA ribs and the black cod teriyaki, and both were quite good. The bento boxes are a particularly good deal since they come with salad, tempura, and 2 small pieces of yam sushi, soup and rice along with the portion of whatever you\\'re getting. Having gotten takeout before, you definitely get a smaller portion of everything, so from a value perspective, I don\\'t really recommend going this route. \\n\\nService is pleasant, and I got what I needed out of them, so I have no complaints. Absolutely the worst sushi in Toronto I have ever had. The salmon appears to have gone through a microwave (see my photo), tuna is flaking and grey. So bad we sent it back. My wife and I popped into Guirei out of convenience the other evening after attending an event at the community centre across the street. We found the place to be clean and we were happy to be seated at a (paper) walled in booth. \\n\\nWe ordered the $49.95 Gui special for two people. First they brought a little amuse bouche of a couple pieces of deep fried maki and a miniature noodle soup. The salad followed which I didn\\'t enjoy as it was a slightly slimy mixture of fresh and pickled vegetables. Miso soup arrived with the salad and it was fine. The tempura was next and that was my favourite part of the meal. It was fresh from the fryer and included 3 shrimp and a variety of vegetables. Our sushi/sashimi/maki platter was next which had a few pieces of salmon and tuna sashimi (the salmon was good, the tuna was mediocre), a few pieces of sushi, and a very average california roll. Next came our teriyaki chicken which we selected from a choice of chicken, beef, or salmon. It was fine, better quality chicken than most teriyakis I\\'ve had, but nothing to write home about. A scoop of green tea ice cream rounded out our meal with a beautifully presented slice of orange. \\n\\nThe service was very good and they timed the arrival of the dishes perfectly. \\n\\nWe got a lot of food but I still think $49.95 was a bit steep. I might go back if I were in the area but would probably make the 10min hike up to King St. for a wider variety of restaurant options. Been here countless times, always good food, always excellent a service. Prices are ok considering the area is expensive. They always have the house amuse bouche noodles and fried fish which elevates the experience. They frequently have specials- look for the sign when you first come in the restaurant. Slow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot.  Lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight!   More expensive to eat in then take out. I went to there only one time, there is very close by my house also I love sushi. that\\'s why I wanted to try here. \\nI ordered \"chirashi don\". It was fine. \\nThe place is nothing special. Came in for the bulgogi lunch bento box and a \"three musketeers\" roll. When I got my order, I was disappointed by how skimpy the roll looked but, on further reflection, it was served exactly as advertised. I guess I got too excited. \\n\\nThe bulgogi was perfectly cooked, tasted great. The tempura worked too, and the miso soup was a nice addition. \\n\\nAll in all, no complaints. Its location near the airport will serve me well in the future, I am sure. I\\'ll be back. Been here several times. Fantastic menu, reasonable prices (especially as it\\'s tourist Haven, Queen\\'s Quay. Friendly unpretentious service too. Our regular Sushi take-out place wasn\\'t delivering last night due to street closures for the MMVAs so we ordered from this place via justeat. Ordered at 7:45 and by 9PM, the food still hadn\\'t arrived (we live just over 1KM away). I called the restaurant and the lady on the line couldn\\'t even tell me for certain that the food had been made, let alone when it would arrive. I then went on live chat with Justeat, who call the restaurant and had the same issues getting information as we did, so we ended up cancelling the order and ordering from someone else instead. Low and behold, at 9:45PM, a full 2 hours since we put through our order, the delivery driver called from the street to say he couldn\\'t find our apartment (ever heard of googlemaps, guys?). We told him we cancelled the order because it was taking way too long, and sent him back to the restaurant.\\n\\nRestaurant owners, if you can\\'t handle the deliveries, please stop using justeat. I\\'m getting really tired of waiting 1.5 hrs + for my food, or never having it arrive at all. Decent. Restaurants along the harbourfront are surprisingly limited for a tourist area. With options such as Shoeless Joes and Swiss Chalet I would say that Guirei is one of the better selections in the harbourfront neighbourhood. \\n\\nGuirei\\'s appearance is like any average sushi restaurant I\\'ve been to in Toronto. Unexpectedly large on the inside, the restaurant is dimly lit with very simple décor, creating a casual dining atmosphere. The noise level of the restaurant is also quiet but that was probably due to the fact that there were only a few customers eating there.\\n\\nThe food was OK. They had a vast amount of items on their menu offering a few \"dishes\" that veered from the typical sushi menu but mostly all were staples. Portion sizes of the food were decent and the overall taste was not mind blowing but not bad. \\n\\nTo start, I was craving something deep fried. I decided to try their \"Soft Shell Crab\" and the \"Agedashi Tofu\".  The Soft Shell Crab was exactly what I expected it to be - battered, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. In terms of taste, there wasn\\'t anything spectacular about it. The crab was subtle in texture and the meat was juicy...and tasted like crab (surprise!). The Agedashi Tofu consisted of fairly large tofu cubes, also deep fried, and topped with bonito flakes. On the first bite, the tofu is crispy but the middle is soft. The sauce it was served in wasn\\'t too salty but was flavourful enough to complement the tofu. \\n\\nFor the main, the \"storm roll\" caught my eye on the menu. It consisted of deep fried salmon with avocado, lettuce, and green onion all rolled into a very big fat sushi roll. It had a predominant salmon taste with a hint of spice. I didn\\'t think the lettuce belonged in the roll as it didn\\'t really add anything to it. It was an unnecessary, soggy ingredient that would not have been missed.\\n\\nOverall, the food and the service were very good. The waitress was friendly and we didn\\'t wait very long for the food. The prices were pretty standard for sushi dining. It wasn\\'t the best in Toronto but definitely worth a try if you are in the neighbourhood. Only tried the sushi, but it was extremely fresh; lots of variety, great service (actual Japanese staff and cooks, who gave us great advice; and didn\\'t charge us for a couple of rolls that were a bit exotic for us. Nice patio across from the lake. It was quiet till about. 7pm; then got packed till close. I lived directly across this spot for a couple years, so it was hard not to give this one a try. \\n\\nFood is average and is your typical neighbourhood sushi joint. Same bento box offerings, Maki/sushi/ sashimi combos - nothing too amazing to mention. I did order their Seafood Udon regularly though when I wanted something with broth and it always did the trick. Spicy, savoury, and full of seafood - it was one thing I could order again and again. Well I think one of the reasons why this place only exists is the total lack of restaurants of any sort in this area. There is a similar place just across the road but it looks like it has the same owner because it\\'s no better. Guys, please increase the quality of your seafood. I don\\'t mine paying more, actually. Please get rid of your Sapporo bear on draft. It\\'s just yellow water with alcohol. My wife got a piece of seashell in her miso soup. Think about it: a piece of seashell in a miso soup?! How come?! :-) Staff was friendly though. Anyone who likes sushi and seafood if you are absolutely stuck in that area then try it. Otherwise go up to King st and have something better for your money. I have lived in the area for about 8 years and have been frequently visiting this establishment since day 1. I have found it to be a consistently good sushi establishment with large sized portions. I personally order the dinner combination #3 on the new menu - Sushi & Maki dinner. I do like to substitute the unagi roll with a spicy tuna roll in this combo as I\\'m not a huge fan of eel. Don\\'t be fooled by the low rating. This place is a good sushi place with large portions and reasonable prices. I got the bibimbap tonight.  it came with a couple of thin, very small pieces of beef, a few maybe 3 or 4 green leafs, 1 egg and the rest of the stone bowl was the rice.   When I asked for more beef, I was given a very small portion contained in a small soy sauce/wasabi dipping container.   Essentially, most of the stone bowl was just rice.  I feel gypped. Though in fairness, they did give a couple of small appetizers. First time there last night. This is a Japanese owned restaurant so the place was very clean, service was gracious and polite and plating and presentation were well thought of. \\nFor a Friday night, the place was not packed. This is definitely a hidden gem. Got the unagi donburi, and the eel was soft and the sauce was just right. Also got a side of spicy scallop sushi... Omg. Definitely going back there again, the sushi quality and service is better than any of the king west joints. This is my local sushi restaurant so I\\'m here a lot and I love it. I usually get the sashimi dinner combo and it\\'s a good amount of food for the price and always delicious. Lunch combos are also well priced and you get a lot. \\n\\nStaff here are friendly and attentive and we\\'re always welcomed with big \"hellos\" from the cooks. \\n\\nWe like sitting in the small private booths near the back. \\n\\nOverall, my go-to sushi restaurant. A 3-hour unscheduled break at work without any food prompted me to finally check out this place which some of my coworkers have raved about.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the Dinner Box A ($21) which came with with your choice of salmon, beef, or chicken teriyaki, your choice of sashimi, sushi, or maki, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and surprisingly, no rice! For $2 more, the Dinner Box B option included rice, sashimi, sushi, AND maki; no tempura though. My dinner wasn\\'t anything special; the chicken was a bit chewy and the teriyaki sauce was pretty watery in consistency. And for $21, it was a bit pricier than the typical bento box.\\n\\nThey do have a separate take-out section in the restaurant, which I imagine they get a lot of orders from, considering the slim pickings in take-out options in the area. While the staff was friendly on the phone and in-person, I, unfortunately, will not be placing any more take-out orders here. This is an excellent place for lunch, but a little pricey for dinner (hence the 3-star rating). Did I mention that it is virtually in the lobby of where I live? Oh yeah, it is pretty convenient. \\n\\nFor lunch, virtually all of the bento boxes are of excellent value -- $10-14 range that come with the entree, miso soup, tempura, and rice. It is a lot of food. My favorite is the beef terriyaki bento. \\n\\nThe one issue I have with this place is that their sashimi is cut too thick, and many of the pieces are too chewy as a result (or it is a lower-grade cut). I\\'ve actually had to COOK the sashimi on a couple of occasions to make it palatable (when I\\'ve taken out) -- no joke! \\n\\nOtherwise, this is a very nice restaurant with a loyal local fan base. I highly recommend it for lunch, but would shy away from it for dinner unless you want to get a bit spendy. Have eaten here at least 20 times between April 2010 and Sept 2011, usually around 3-4pm, mainly because it\\'s the only sit-down restaurant within a ten minute walk from my work.\\n\\nFood is generally very fresh.  Pretty good dynamite roll, tempura appetizer, banana fritters for dessert.  I always miss the lunch specials b/c of the time of my work lunch or would\\'ve tried that long ago.  So it forces me into getting two a la carte items, usually two of the three above, since I don\\'t want to spend $19.99 on the dinner combo.  Then again, my bill usually comes to around $17 after taxes, so it\\'s 20 by the time I tip.  \\n\\nService is 90% of the time very friendly and stereotypical of the many Japanese restaurants I\\'ve been at in Toronto.  All smiles, politeness, female-only, dressed in cultural style.  Usually they are quite attentive, making sure the complimentary green tea is topped up, your food is good, etc.  A few times I had to wait very long, which I attribute to them being short staffed maybe?  The place is never really busy when I go, often three or four tables occupied inside, and if it\\'s the summer, one or two outside are taken on the patio.  I always prefer the patio if it\\'s nice out, as you can watch planes taking off from the city airport.\\n\\nDebit & credit accepted.  Liquor licensed. Great sushi, terrible  customer service.\\nThey should consider stepping up their game since a brand new sushi place opened right across the street. \\nWill NOT be coming back. By far the worst sushi experience I\\'ve had.  While waiting for our delayed flight at Billy Bishop Airport, we decided to leave the terminal for a while to check out the nearby restaurants.  I checked Yelp to see what was around and unfortunately Guirei was the only nearby open establishment.  \\n\\nEven though it was lunchtime, the place wasn\\'t that busy (which should have been a warning sign).  It was a beautiful day, but all of the 4-person tables (I was with a few other people) were occupied by single diners, so we had to cram onto a smaller table.\\n\\nLet me say this first: the service was, for the most part, very good.  Our server was attentive and understanding of our numerous complaints.  They could do a little more about dining area management (aka, making sure parties of 4 don\\'t have to sit at tiny tables while single diners take up 4-seaters), but that\\'s about it.\\n\\nAnd now on to the food... Our lunch dishes came out soon after ordering (we mentioned having a flight to catch), but there was just something off about everything.  One person in our party ordered the LA Shortribs (supposedly a special), but were really just warmed up in the microwave.  I ordered the sashimi bento box, but was less than impressed.  All of the sashimi had a fishy/frozen taste and smell, which was an immediate turnoff.  Determined not to let this ruin my experience, I forged ahead through the sashimi plate but stopped all together half-way through the tuna.  A hair.  Yes, a long black hair was found in between two of my sashimi pieces.  On the plate, sure, I can understand that.  But *in between* two pieces of the same kind of sashimi is very unusual. Love, love, LOVE the bentobox.\\n\\nThe quality of the sashimi is nice but nothing to brag about. Definitely a bang for the buck: the Bento box lunch. Good quality green tea and nice sake list rounds out the experience\\n\\n Service can be sloth like so ask for the check when lunch arrives otherwise bring a flare-gun to get the attention of the geisha like servers. I can\\'t even remember the service, or whatever people are complaining about.. All I can remember is the taste.  It was easily the best sushi I\\'ve ever eaten and I\\'ve eaten at 99,898 Sushi restaurants in my life.  So thats about 10 percent of the Sushi restaurant population on King Street.. Ughhh, the worst is Sushi-Q; they don\\'t give a fudge! But GuiRei best restaurant EVER! I got the Maki and Tempura dinner for $20.00 and have a slew of regrets. Not only was the sushi terrible quality (every piece I picked up fell apart between my chopsticks - which never happens elsewhere), but I did not enjoy the taste and was left feeling less than satisfactory. The service was the real culprit here - TERRIBLE! Not only did they bring us the inncorrect order twice, but we had to ask for water multiple times before finally getting our waters after receiving our entree. Additionally it took us at least 20 minutes to finally get the attention of a server. Despite all of this though, when we got the servers attention they were extremely nice and welcoming, and the dishes my friends got (Chicken Teriyaki and BiBimBap) were much better than my dish. Overall, I would give Guirei Japanese Resturant a 2.5/3 star rating out of 5. SIDE NOTE: The resturant was moderately busy, but not busy enough to the point where service was that bad; it did not take long at all for us to be seated). Also, there were bugs constantly flying around everywhere - very annoying. My wife and i have been regulars for at least 5 years now, we generally call ahead and order for pick up.  Food is consistently great, no complaints whatsoever. Hands down the best tempura in Toronto.  Finally, we\\'ve found a place that does tempura as good as Vancouver sushi resto\\'s.  The sushi is fresh as well, no complaints.']]"
