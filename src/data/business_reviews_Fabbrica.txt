Yummmmmers.

Absolutely ZERO complaints. Just stellar!

Went to lunch with a friend to catch up - ended up spending two hours there! (And, side note - never once felt like anyone wanted us to vacate even though we had finished our meal... nice!)

Service was impeccable. Attentive, masterful, love it. I enjoy the luxury of having a skilled team working to make my dining experience one I'd write home (a.k.a. Yelp) about. 

Bread on the table was gorgeous, rustic, divine.

We both had pizzas - me margherita, he pepperoni. Both ended up taking more than half home with us. Gotta love that! More filling than your average, run-of-the-mill Napoli-style pizza in the GTA. 

Note about doggy bags here: they take your plate away, and bring you back a ticket (Ã  la coat check). You keep that ticket and PICK UP YOUR FOOD FROM THE HOSTESS AT THE FRONT who has been keeping it in the FRONT fridge for you. Whaaaaat? Beautiful.

Attention to detail at this place is one of the things that makes it 5 stars for me. The salt and pepper dispensers on the table, the cheese graters, the coffee accessories, etc. - all noteworthy, DIFFERENT than anywhere else I've seen. The coffee, btw, is also great.

The design of the space is really interesting and somehow manages to feel cozy/rustic and clean/modern at the same time. Well done, FAB-brica. Ahhhh, Vivek-worthy puns.
