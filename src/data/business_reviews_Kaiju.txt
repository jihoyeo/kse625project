The first time I went to Kaiju was when they first opened almost two years ago. I had heard great things about Kaiju, but I was still apprehensive about the quality of the food. I mean, they are in a food court - how great could it possibly be? Well, I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, fresh and decently priced (most items under $10). But what really made them great and separated them from most food establishments was the service. The Kaiju team is kind, passionate, professional and so thankful for your business. They truly love making people happy ...

So why did I stay away for over 6 months? Cause I am an idiot! I've been busy and did not make the trek to the Gerrard and Yonge area until last Saturday when I had a major craving for curry and fish. I brought my friend with me who had never tried Kaiju, and he really enjoyed the meal. But what he fell head over heels in love with was their tofu cheesecake. So much so, that he goes to Kaiju every Saturday to stock up on tofu cheesecake (they only sell it on Saturdays). 

Take a wild guess where we are going today? Yep! On our way now!
