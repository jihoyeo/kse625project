Tuck the other guys. This place is the tastiest junk I've had in the Junction! 

I'm smack in the middle of mat leave, and The Greatest Baby Of Them All* and I took a little staycation in the Junction Triangle. Why? Because my baby papa had to take a work trip for the second time in a couple of weeks, and I wanted an extra set of hands. Enter awesome friends who gave us their guest room and cooed at the bae while I took little breaks. Hooray for true blue buddies. 

While checking out their hood, I stumbled upon Tuckshop and I'm obsessed. Delicious handmade sandwiches. Adorable little patio. Sweetest little treats and necessities... just like a real Tuckshop. Grab the BLT add cheese. You won't be disappointed.
