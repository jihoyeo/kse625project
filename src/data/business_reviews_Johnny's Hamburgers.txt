Johnny's burger's are probably one of the best burgers in Toronto that I've eaten. This is a family run restaurant and you need to pay with cash. From the outside, it looks like a dump but the burgers are actually really really good. Johnny's is literally a takeout restaurant as there are no tables or chairs to sit. People usually just go and eat in their cars. However, they can do this because their food is really good. Every time I have eaten here, I have not been disappointed. The burgers are extremely tender and seasoned just right. The entire burger itself is really big and 1 will usually fill most people. The fries are ok but it's called Johnny's Hamburgers. Not Johnny's Fries.

Usually around noon, the place is packed so if you can, go a little later or try and hit it up early. Especially if it's on a week day where everyone from work goes and gets a burger.
