Good God, woman. Go to DaiLo. 

I glommed on to my husband's work dinner recently, as I'm known to do, and I'm extra glad I did this time. The chef's tasting dinner at DaiLo was one of the most beautiful meals I've had in recent memory. 

There were many, many courses, but these were my favourites. If you only get these, you will have a memorable meal:

+Fried watermelon 
+Hakka brown wontons 
+Whole fried trout 
+Mai Tai
+Vodka martini

Fine, you caught me, those last two are liquor. But trust me, they don't just know their way around a kitchen, they're fierce with their shakers and tiki cups, too.
