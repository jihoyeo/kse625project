If you're going to San Francesco Foods, be sure to wear a hair tie in your hair, for when you go to San Francesco Foods, you're gonna encounter some dripping gravy there and you don't want to get it all over your hair, even if you are a hippie from the 60s.

What to get: The Veal Sandwich... yumm.
What else: Well, it depends on how you Veal.

Their famous Veal Sandwich is obviously not that famous on Yelp, but it should be, because it's one of the best and juiciest sandwiches in Canada's largest metro area. It wasn't the best thing I've ever tasted, but in a city which has often thrown underwhelming food at me (literally, when I performed on stage, usually in the form of rotten vegetables), this was a real treat. I was starving, and every drop of the juicy gravy and vivacious Veal (oh crap I just misused that word) went down well.

The sandwich didn't save very well (I got another one for later), got very soggy and wasn't as much fun cold... so eat it right when you get it. And I'd recommend adding some peppers and onions and stuff to it, otherwise it can be a bit bland. But every visitor to Toronto and lover of juicy sandwiches, should stop by here one evening and check it out. It's worth it, even moreso than Fifth Harmony.

And no Moez, the sandwiches have just the right amazing delicious amount of oil. Putting a ton of oil on something is never a bad idea, and I'm not just talking about food.

Wanna take a trip with me? I feel like they might have good Veal sandwiches in France-le'sgo!!
