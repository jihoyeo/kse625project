On my Toronto visit, wanted to dine in the Fashion District off Queen's street. This place was POPPIN!  Loud and busy, filled with beautiful people!  2nd floor is the ideal rooftop dining.  Seats/tables are small and uncomfortable but you'll put up with it once you've had a bite of their food.

Kale Salad and Funghi Pasta was the highlight of the night!  We came back to this place twice because I loved my meal so much!  Thank you for a wonderful time!
