Before I start this off, I just want to put up a little bias alert: I just threw an event with the lovely people at The Fifth Inc, specifically the Pub House, so obviously I am partial to the people there. I worked closely with them for months and they are all lovely.

This being said, I've been in the space as a paying customer a few times independently of the event planning, so I'm going to give them the lovin' review they deserve. 

Their mac and cheese is off the hook. Toss a little hot sauce in there, and it's probably one of my favourite comfort food dishes in the city. Simple. Gooey. Near perfect. They have over a dozen beers on tap at reasonable prices (especially for the Entertainment District), $5 martinis on Tuesdays and ever-changing drink specials. 

I don't spend much time in this part of Toronto anymore, but all my office-bound friends will be hearing me recommend this place for a pick-me-up lunch (the fatty kind) or an after work drink for years to come.
