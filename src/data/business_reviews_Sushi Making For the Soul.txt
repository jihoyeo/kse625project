Recently I have started taking cooking classes. The first item on my list that I wanted to learn how to make was sushi. I eat it often enough, why not make it for myself? But come on! Let's be realistic here. Sure, there are many things that I like to eat, many of which I could probably make myself, but actually go through all the trouble? Not likely. But I was hoping it would be different with sushi. Plus, I was looking to impress friends at my next gathering by showing them my sushi creations. "Oh yeah! I made that. FROM SCRATCH!"

My friend and I had a great time in this class. I particularly enjoyed hearing about the history of sushi and like a big kid I got a kick of getting my hands dirty while I attempted to make the different types of rolls. I do suggest however that you invite friends/family to take this class with you. In this class you are bound to have a great time and learn a great deal because everyone was so friendly and Sang is very sociable, yet I feel that it will be a better experience for you if you partake on this sushi-making adventure with people you can be silly with. As my friend pointed out to me during the class as I pushed myself to make the 'best roll' in the class...."Itanni relax. Just have fun!" And I did have fun.
