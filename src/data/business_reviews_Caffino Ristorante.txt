I'm already updating my Caffino Ristorante review, because I have already returned, and they deserve the five star bump. What a delight! 

My husband and I had cocktails and mussels followed by pasta and wine on their patio while our baby napped and it was a near perfect evening. Saying this is a hidden gem is such a clichÃ©, but goddamnit, that's what it is. Check out Caffino, it's a shiny hidden gem.
