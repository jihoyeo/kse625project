Freshest seafood find in Scarborough area! We were greeted by huge King crabs and lobsters in the clean water tanks upon entering the restaurant.  We tried the spicy Hong Kong style fried crab, steamed Lobster with Garlic and Lobster Congee -- enjoyed all the dishes, especially the spicy HK style fried crab.  Lots more dishes to try here such as Geoduck, oysters...  and a 4-pounder fresh lobster!

If this was like Instagram I can say @Johnny thanks man

Johnny's friend visited from Miami and they said, "Let's share lobsters." Originally I didn't know what that meant. What? 

So we ordered I think 2? lobsters. Plus the fried rice. It was about $30 per person for 10 people. Two dishes!! That's it. 

The process:
1) order
2) staff will pick the lobsters in front of you, making sure you approve of them
3) in a SHORT amount of time, the mountain of lobster arrives. It takes two people to lift it to your table!

The lobster mountain is flavourful and surrounded by loads and loads and loads of small tiny fish (deep fried). So you can literally "dig in" and scoop handfuls and put them into your mouth. Then get a new glove, or not. Honestly I didn't mind if other people were digging in and making a mess. 

The fried rice was delicious!!!!!! I had so much of it. I couldn't decide if my next "bite" is going to be the rice or the lobster. Both were equally amazing. It was difficult to choose what to fill my mouth with (hahaha).

I loooooooooooooooooooooooved it. The experience itself, I really want to take my family here. But alas I have no money. And I'd feel bad if they were to pay. Some day.
