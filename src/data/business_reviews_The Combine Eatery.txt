GREAT place. 

1. Fab vibe, great atmosphere, great location. Love this area of the D-forth!

2. Staff are, without exception, AWESOME. Especially owner Amy and her bro Albert! They make you feel so welcome, like you are going to a party in their home. Great sense of humour, clear passion for what they do. It's an infectious mood.

3. GREAT. DRINKS. The bartender(s?) is really, really, really good. In our case, it was Albert... but I saw Amy shaking a mean martini while we were there too! ;)

4. Cool decor. Art by locals (mostly B&W if I remember correctly). Furnishings are rad all-around - cool lighting fixtures, open brick and metal pipes... Art is for sale too! Love it!

5. Food. YUM. Fresh, flavourful, though I guess I'd better admit I didn't have fish tacos! Ha! That seems to be the most popular item. I had an omelet (a special) and home fries - came with fresh and interesting (read: no melon) fruit salad as well. YUM all around - and everyone in our party felt similar (we ordered every item on the brunch menu between the six of us, I think).

We went for brunch, obviously, and they opened a few minutes early just for us (we didn't check the hours before heading out) and YES, we drank. My mimosa was PERFECTION. I put it on par with Fire on the East Side, and for those of you that know me, you know that is my #1 mimosa place. You see what I mean.

We ate on the back patio, which was airy and intimate, though it can seat about 50 people (I asked). We sat at a gorgeous (and huge) table made out of a huge log of wood! This back area would be a fabulous place for a private summer party! Hmmmm...
