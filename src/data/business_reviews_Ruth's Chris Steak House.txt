After eating at the Ruth Chris in Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis and NYC, I decided to take my family out for dinner there one night. Well. I got the porterhouse for 2 and split it with my dad. The meat is unbelievable. This is one of the best chain steakhouses in the US and after seeing one in Toronto, I had to go there. The atmosphere is really dark and perfect. They have a nice wood siding along the walls that is really cool. My mom and my brother both got steaks while my grandmother got some fish. She doesn't eat meat anymore. But you go there for the steaks. My porterhouse was medium rare and was just beautiful to look at and to sink my teeth into. The meat melted the second it went into my mouth. They brought out the meat on a separate plate and gave my dad and I another hot plate with butter melted on it. They then took a slice of meat off and dipped it in the butter and swirled it around. It was amazing. 

Oh. If you're going with an even number of people, get the porterhouse for 2 and split it. You get more meat and it's a little bit cheaper. Not to mention better. Don't get two separate steaks for 2 people. Not worth it.

Anyways, I ordered some creamed spinach, asparagus and sauteed mushrooms as a side for everyone. The creamed spinach is not as good as the one from Peter Lugers but hey, you can't usually match something that good. 

I ordered 2 bottles of wine which helped run the tab up a little bit more. For desert, I got the creme brulee while my mom got some sort of chocolate cake. The total tab was close to $500 before tip but we had about 6 people eating and 2 bottles of wine. There were also appetizers thrown in there as well.

The service was impeccable. I love being waited on by people who know what they are doing and these guys knew what they were doing. They also know a lot about their meat which helped everything out as well.
