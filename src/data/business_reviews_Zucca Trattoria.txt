Gosh...I'm the first person to write a review about this place??

I'm shocked and need to spread the word that this is the best Italian in Toronto. Forget Mistura and all your other high end restos.

Authentic, simple quality ingredients. Anti pasto platter and grilled fish. Superb service and great value. Just like in Rome.

Again....you want Italian, go here!
