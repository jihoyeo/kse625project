I love this place for consistent Cantonese food, done fast, done deliciously and for great value. The family is always hitting up this location because it never fails. It's packed at peak hours with tons of Chinese folks. The ultimate seal of approval. 

Noodle soups, rice, congee, all the usual suspects are done well. Yes, the service is lacking for typical Cauasian standards, but that's because they are busy and you need to eat and get out. Time is money and they know people are busting down the door. 

Another example of the solid GTA Chinese food scene.
