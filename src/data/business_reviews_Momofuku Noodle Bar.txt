The Ramen was delicious, with lots of components of different flavours and textures.  I thought it was well executed.  The 8 minute egg was a nice accent.  The desert was fantastic.  Overall, the meal was well priced.  In my opinion, the communal seating only adds to the experience.  

In the negative column, the fried rice was a little disappointing.  Also, the menu is pretty minimal.  Still, the highlights were high to detract from the negatives.  I believe that David Chang does not disappoint with this restaurant.

Yelp is my bible, specifically Yelp Toronto, and my fave site and app rarely gets it wrong. The reviews for Momofuku Noodle Bar are skewed towards the negative, and I'm here to try to right this ship. This palatial glass fortress of food is worth fighting for! 

Was this the case of other people not wanting to love it to seem cool in the wake of some other negative reviews? Did they just get off to a rocky start? I don't know, but I do know that I had one of the best meals I've had in ages here the other night. 

My small group was quite tipsy, but that didn't stop our waiter from treating us like royalty. We had sparkling wine and beers, and then hit the food hard. Pork buns, noodles, sprouts, and chicken and caviar. The chicken wasn't for me, because I'm just not a sweets person and it was drunk on maple, but the rest of the food was complete perfection. 

Lastly, I'd just like to note that there are a lot of comments like "not as good as NYC" listed here, and I think that's bunk. I appreciate the comparisons, but it sounds more like you're showing off for being well-traveled, because plate for plate the ingredients here are fresher and more plentiful. At first I questioned this was just my allegiance to the crown rearing it's pointed head, but I was dining with two buddies from New York, and they echoed my sentiments.

Long live Momofuku Toronto!
