So my last update was a little off. They have stopped with the oysters, and the patio isn't in full swing, but...

They have done some pop-up menus with varying chefs, but it looks like they've got some keepers for supper hour and they aren't messing around. Get some of their delish delights (think: tortiere, pea soup with biscuits and braised beef poutine) to go with your craft cocktails and reasonably priced wine and beer. Mmm K?

Very nice coffee place. Great oatmeal raisin cookies

I spent the better part of a day at Northwood and enjoyed it so much I wasn't even tired of being there at the end of it all. The atmosphere is great for working during the day and socializing during the evening. Seriously, this cafe covers it all.

An added bonus of being there so long means that I experienced a lot of what they have to offer, and from lattes to sparkling wine at happy hour, to cheese plates, everything I had I liked.

The menus are small, but creative and the staff is efficiently friendly. It would be one of my main hangs if I lived in Toronto.
