This place is authentic, delicious, quaint, fun and quirky. Where rustic tables, iPad menus and the worlds largest (and greatest) meatballs collide in perfect harmony with a rockin' soundtrack.

They have some bad-ass old school cocktails with some new world twists, and a wine list that would thrill anyone - wankers not included. 

I was there with a large group, and they basically kept bringing us the best of the best. If you ask your server to just surprise you, you won't be sorry. Also, for what it is, this place doesn't break the bank and the servers are honest folk who won't just bring you the most expensive things on the menu.

And seriously... get the meatballs... with the wine.
