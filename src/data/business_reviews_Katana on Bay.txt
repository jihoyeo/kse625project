Blowfish is an elegant, beautiful, and classy Japanese fusion restaurant on Bay and Adelaide. They have some of the most unique menu items and can definitely attract food adventurers, putting aside of course the hefty price.

======YOU MUST
Blowfish Giant Ebi Shooter ($14, tiger prawn, mango, avocado, cucumber, lettuce, daikon sprout, tempura bits, spicy kewpie, tobiko; wrapped with soy paper) - You see the current Yelp cover image for Blowfish? That Pomegranate Mojito glass? This shooter comes in that glass. It's actually a handroll sushi but instead of seaweed it's wrapped in soy paper. It's absolutely delicious! Mind your manners here!

Tuna Taco ($16, diced tuna, negi, frizee, daikon sprout and Japanese tartar; served in crispy wonton taco) - Amazing, so yummy and it's stuffed with tuna. They were not stingy! The tuna tastes very light in flavor so it blends well with all other ingredients. 

Spicy Rock Shrimp ($20, tempura style, tossed in hot garlic kewpie sauce) - If you're a huge shrimp fan, THIS IS A MUST. These are giant fat shrimps drenched in amazing spicy sauce. But nothing overpowers another!

One more item (I forgot!!!!) I believe it was a some sort of tuna tataki. It comes in a long plate with lots of slices. The sauce is a little (teenie weenie) sweet and it brought out the tuna flavor extremely well. The tuna tataki was very fresh, not smooshy soft (I hate those!), and thick. 

======OTHER SO-SO ITEMS I SHOULD POINT OUT...
Golden King Crab ($17, king crab, treviso, egg, pine nuts, avocado, cucumber, asian spices, golden tobiko) - I thought this tasted quite boring... the crab had very little flavor, the avocado stood out so much. 

Sea urchin sushi - Too soft, watery, not flavorful. I've had better.

======CONCLUSION
This place can get expensive if you'd like to try lots of items. Don't be boring and order "regular" items like spicy salmon (you can get that anywhere! Although Blowfish does make an amazing spicy salmon roll), go for something different and enjoy it! 

Service? 3 stars. Hit and miss, which is unacceptable given its location. Nonetheless, the GOOD waiters and waitresses here are very hospitable and polite.

======I MUST MENTION THE LOOK & FEEL...
Blowfish is truly modern and beautiful. Dim, classy lighting. Full bar to the right, coffee tables to the left by the window. It also has this booth table where it feels as though you are engulfed in a large open barrel. It's not scary, sorry. It's a round table at the center of a giant wooden-like barrel, it's like a mini lounge. It feels nice, promise. The washrooms are shared male/female (and it's quite dirty...), each stall is complete with a fish tank -with mini fish.
