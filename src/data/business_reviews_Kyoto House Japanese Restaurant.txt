I couldn't disagree with Tammy's review more. What an amazing find. Staying at the Met downtown I wandered past this little sushi joint on the corner. I have to admit that I was a little scared. I've eaten sushi all over the US and Canada and I've been to all you can eat sushi in Vancouver, and even there the places are hit and miss. 

It was getting quite late so we decided to take the risk and went into Kyoto House Japanese Restaurant to give it a try. We couldn't be more pleased!!! 

Everything is MADE TO ORDER! 

The Tempura was fresh, light and flaky and better than about 90% of tempura that I have ordered in the past (let me tell you, that is a lot!). The had the Salmon Sashimi and it was so fresh, melty and buttery -- it drove me crazy!!! I got three more orders (both yesterday and when I went back today!) 

Oh, I feel like I am betraying my favorite Korean restaurants when I say this... but the Beef Short ribs?! SO DARN GOOD. The Teriyaki sauce for the chicken is made "in house", but I prefer white meat (the chicken is a mixture) so my best friend enjoyed this more. Miso is traditional -- and all of the rolls (both hand roll, and sushi rolls we tried did not disappoint). Spider, Dragon, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura? Check Check Check!! 

The staff was friendly, fast and attentive. English is a second language, but they keep the food coming, even when you are ordering a mixture of fresh, raw, cooked and rolls. 

I haven't tried the lunch menu, it's much simpler. I would pay the extra few dollars and opt for dinner. It's worth it! 

I will go back, I can't help myself... and I can't wait to take my other best friend here. For under a $20 price tag, how could I ever say no!?
