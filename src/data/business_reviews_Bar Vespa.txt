I came here two weeks ago, Friday night Sept 23rd. I wanted to visit because of a review I read on Sweetspot.ca, so I took my boyfriend here! Free street parking also :) :) 

We came here for drinks. I had the Dolomiti (which was absolutely awesome), and my bf had the Sophia, which was good too. We shared a plate of the Calamaretti. I usually don't like fried seafoods due to the batter, but theirs was reeeeaalllyyy gooooddd. There were lots of squid meat, and they weren't tiny! And the spicy marinara was reeally really super. 

Before the Calamaretti came, the server gave us a plate of bread and some.. butter..ish something, spices from somewhere in yellow liquid, I'm guessing it's melted butter. I don't remember what it was, sorry! And I'm someone who doesn't eat bread with butter, just because I don't like that greasy taste, but this was SOOOOO yummy. I was swirling my bread in that "butter", it was gooooddddd.

All the waiters there were very nice. I was walking to the washroom downstairs, and a waitress casually said, "Hi, how's it going?" as she was walking to the kitchen, downstairs too. We had like a 45sec convo :p

I reeally really like it there! Clean, elegant, waiters were friendly, food was good. Also, when we were there... there were only maybe 5 other tables filled so it was a little quiet and I like that a lot :) Reminder that this was two weeks ago, and not Sept 30 like Mary's review!
