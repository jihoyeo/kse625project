Smack dab in the middle of Chinatown is this place. Offering twists, fusions and concoctions borrowing from all the local cultures. Kinda ballsy in chinatown, don't ya think? It absolutely works though. :)

I had seen this place so many times and heard good things about it. So when the opportunity came up to try this place and I jumped at the chance.

I was impressed from the get go. Customer service was incredible not just from the servers but from anyone that worked the space including the owner. Nothing felt contrived or forced which  was pretty cool. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. 

On to the food. Portions are absolutely meant to be shared. You won't be full by ordering 2 dishes. Go with friends and try at least 4.  When went with recommendations that didn't steer us astray.  

We had the general tso fu - a sticky, crunchy deliciousness! Highly recommend! The butter lamb croquettes were such a wonderful bite - I wanted to eat everyone elses share. The morroccan eggplant was incredible. Try it with every element its presented with - you won't regret it.  The crispy thai pork was interesting because it successfully paired jackfruit with pork belly.  The star of the dishes was the duck. Tender and flavourful. Very well executed dish.

We finished with a customer favourite dessert - a sticky toffee pudding made with maple. This was heaven.

Drinks? Yes! I had the monk mule!Very nice balance of flavours. One of the first times that the ginger didn't take over the flavour!

Would I return? Ohhhh, hell yes!
