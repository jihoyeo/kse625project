Full disclosure: I recently did a couple of events with North Poke and after getting to sample their deliciousness two nights not too long ago, I was craving it again hard. I've since been back two more times as a paying customer. 

I am all about their Hawaii Classic, tuna sharply marinated in perfection, hold the onions. Their middle size is all you need for a very filling meal, but if you're starving there's a massive size, too. This summer they're going to start serving shaved ice, and I look forward to popping for a cool down once the weather warms up. Aloha!
