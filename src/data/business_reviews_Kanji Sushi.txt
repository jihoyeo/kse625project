If you had asked me before going how I'd feel about a large sushi place in Parkdale that kind of turns into a lounge with multiple bars as the night progresses, I'd tell you that sounded like my nightmare. Boy was I wrong. I Heart Kanji and so will you!

They're nice if you're a walk-in even though they get slammed on the weekends. They're really great about sending you to the bar area for one of their artisan cocktails, and seating you promptly for dinner. Their food price point is low considering how fresh their rolls are, and their tempura plates are large and in charge. 

Don't let their sleek lounge-y-ness intimidate you, this is a great venue with an authentic sushi/Izakaya menu and once you're full... why not stay for a drink or two? The DJ is playing fun yet not intrusive tunes on the weekends. Word. 

Kan I get some more Kanji? Yes please! 

PEPPER POINTS for being so great with large groups. A splendid place for a celebration of 10 or so!
