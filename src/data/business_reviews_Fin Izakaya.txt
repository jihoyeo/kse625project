Everything is super delicious.  Melt-in-your mouth pork belly keeps revisiting me in my dreams.  The service is always friendly and reliable.  The staff give you a nice welcome holler when you enter the restaurant.  I only wish my wife was this happy to see me come home at the end of the workday.  One of my favourite restaurants in the city.
