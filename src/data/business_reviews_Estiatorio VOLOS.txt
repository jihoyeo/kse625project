Went last night after the amazing concierge person at the Shangri-La hotel said this is one of her favorite spots. We walked in and where suprised on how classy this place was... The food was not your typical Greek place, it had cornish hens with  feta and a rugala salad that was amazing..then we had the chicken soup .. A+ soup.. berries for dessert. Waitress was fantastic... A recommend... Bravo..

You've got a friend in VOLOS. 

The huge interior is white, airy and sweeps your mind away to Greece. This sort of pleasant atmosphere lends itself to tranquility, shared plates, and drinks with lunch... and there ain't nothing wrong with that. 

I have never had Greek wine before, so when the server recommended a glass of Greek sparkling ros√© I was hesitant, but quickly won over. What a crisp glass of bubbly! Beyond the wine, favourites include: flaming cheese, the unmatched-in-freshness Greek salad and the octopus. 

Opa!
