Prior to my trip to Toronto this past weekend, I made sure to do my homework when it came to food. A Top 10 of Toronto site had this as one of the top 10 Hakka restaurants in town. I didn't know what Hakka food was, so I had to do some research, and to sum it up: Chinese with a mix of Indian.

The restaurant is on Dundas, a few blocks from the Dundas-Yonge Square, Toronto's version of Time's Square, so for those in downtown, its not a far trek.

Almost everyone highly recommends the Spicy Peanuts Chicken; I do as well! This sweet-spicy chicken dish was wonderful and worth getting again.
