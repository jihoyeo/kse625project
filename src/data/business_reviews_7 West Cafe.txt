Walking up Younge Street can be sketchy. The strip is filled with grimy restaurants, fast food joints, stripper bars, and weird souvenir shops (no I would not like to buy a ceramic figurine of Mickey Mouse). Hidden just off of Younge is the gem that is 7 West Caf√©.

Arriving at midnight, I had a mission: To study for my exam, and to eat. As soon as I stepped into the low-lit town house, I knew my mission was possible.

The atmosphere was just what I needed. Enough liveliness to keep me awake, but not so loud and distracting that I wouldn't be able to focus. 

Being a student, I'm used to spending 10 dollars on a meal AT MOST. I'm not used to shelling it out. At 7 West? You have to shell it out a little. This being said, what with the price range being a little higher the food is that much better! This is no greasy spoon my friends. Oh no. Waaaaay delicious. And healthy? Way more healthy then greasy fries. I myself ordered the "Moroccan Chilly" ($6) and a bowl (yes a bowl) of tea ($3). Super yummy. Oh and my servers? THE NICEST! 

Quiet, calm, yet alive 7 West quickly became a favorite of mine by the time I walked out the door... at 4 am.

Can't wait to go back. Hopefully with more monies in my pocket.
