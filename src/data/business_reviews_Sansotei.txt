Give me a bowl of perfectly flavoured broth with yummy ramen noodle, complete with pork belly and soft-boiled eggs and I'm a fan. This new location is a lot like the original one on dundas, but with one plus: they have a deal for $12 for any ramen + bottle of sapporo. Steal! The Sapporo would normally be $6.50, so you save about $3 on this combo!

I always get the Tonkatsu Black with extra pork belly, and it was just as good here as Dundas....and I'm a bit convinced the bowls are bigger too. Will be returning again!
