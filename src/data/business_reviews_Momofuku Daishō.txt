One of the better restaurants in Toronto. Probably in my top 3 in Toronto. Make sure to do a reservation before coming. 

The crispy chicken buns are fantastic and a must for the appetizers. The oysters are always changing but the cucumber and kimchi sauce that they use with it is delicious. The roasted mushroom salad was delicious as well and contained a lot of different types of mushrooms.

The star of the meal was the whole trout. This is a must if you have never been here. Even if you hate fish, you will love the trout here. It was probably one of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten. The entire fish was already de-boned and you just had to remove the head and tail which was very easily done. The flesh was extremely soft and with the sauce, the perfect combination. 

I usually don't like corn but the sweet corn was highly recommended by our server so I had to give it a shot. I was not let down. 

By the time the dessert menu had come, we were full. Not overstuffed but full. However, the desserts looked so good that my girlfriend and I actually ordered 3 desserts. The donuts were ok. It didn't compare with the rest of the meal. However, the apple crumble was a hit as well as the peach cobbler.
