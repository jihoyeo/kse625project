Loved this restaurant. I think it deserves more than its four stars. Pasta was outstanding. Cooked perfectly al dente. You can tell they make the pasta themselves. Delicious. We had three kinds at our table: caico e pepe, carbonara, and amatriciana. All three were so tasty, but I'd have to say the caico e pepe was the stand out. Yum. We also tried the arancini, which were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. Also a great dish. My father had the branzino. It's probably the best preparation of branzino I've ever tasted, and I only had a small bite. Very well done. Three of us shared the Ontario ribeye with our pasta. So flavorful and cooked nicely. It's why I always try to order steak at an Italian restaurant over a steakhouse. Focus goes into the flavor of the cooking rather than just the quality of the steak. Slow service, but I think it's just because I'm American.

You can book a cheese cellar here for private events.

The above statement is enough to garner this place five sexy stars without hesitation. 

Enoteca Sociale is some of the best Italian food I've had in Toronto. I went in with a colleague and we started with some whiskey cocktails, red wine and their fabulous house made bread. I had the rigatoni with red-wine braised beef. The meat was soft and exquisite. The portion initially seemed small, and I knew I was going to want more but I was perfectly full at the end. We over serve pasta on this side of the pond, and this place keeps it real. 

It's definitely a date night kind of place, and I'll bring my sweetie back here. Not that I didn't have a lovely candlelit meal with Yelp's Biz Outreach manager... I just recommend this joint for couples over colleagues.
