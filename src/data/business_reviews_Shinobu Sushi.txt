Menu items: Salmon Sashimi, Seafood Don, Hotate Rolls and Spicy Tuna Roll

The unpretentious 20 seat restaurant on the Yonge strip is right to make claim as one of Toronto's best sushi restaurants, or maybe I am the one making the claim. Either way, this place competes head to head with famous Toronto restaurants such as Yuzu, To-ne and even Guu Izayaka!

Shinobu's selection of sashimi is best described as fresh, flavourful and beautifully sliced. From the salmon to the tuna, this Japanese restaurant stole my taste buds away in blink of a bite!

The Seafood Don is a perfectly assembled bowl of sashimi sitting on a bed of rice, sprinkled with green onion, soy sauce and fish eggs. From white tuna, to scallops, salmon and shrimp, the assortment of fresh fish on a rice bowl is a must order at 

Playing on the scallop tune, which to me was probably the best sashimi symphony of the day; the Hotate Dream Roll truly portraits the knife skills and expertise from the chefs at Shinobu. The roll consists of spicy salmon mix wrapped with avocado and topped with thin slices of scallop and salmon roe (aka salmon eggs). Yum, yum, yum.

And because to me there is no such thing as too much sushi, I couldn't help but also give the Spicy Tuna rolls a try, which are basically a similar take to the Hotate roll sans the scallop. The ingredient that gave a whole new taste to the otherwise traditional roll, was the sesame seeds, socking up all the flavour and moist from the rice and slowly releasing it back in one's palate. Another mush order at Shinobu.

Buen Provecho,
