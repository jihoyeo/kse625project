Hello my name is Kate. And I love boogers. I mean burgers. 
Sorry couldn't help myself. Sometimes I have the humor of a 5 year old. Moving on! Burger talk time! 

As a burgers and beer enthusiast, BQM fits my needs. Yummy beers and even yummier burgers. Not to mention the yummy poutine as well. All of this at a price my student wallet can afford?! Sign me (and my tummy) up!

The staff are nice and the booths are cozy. I went on a date here once, and yes I chose the location. Did the date go well? No. But my delicious burger (which had an onion ring in it!) comforted me. 

With it's convenient Queen St. W location, I've been here many times but have yet to eat on their patio! Add that to my places to try and patio this summer list!

Over all? Yum. Go.
