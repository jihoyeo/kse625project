This place is 5 stars because it's:
- very quiet on a weeknight
- excellent service (especially in this snobby area, no offence)
- basic list of draught beers. It's all I come here for
- food is alright, it's okay. Can't complain. Pricey for the "okay" food.
- quiet patio, nobody walks there -because it's not on a major street! I love it!

There's a dinner menu as well as a bar (appetizer) menu. They usually hand out the bar menu after 5, so if you're hungry, ASK FOR THE DINNER MENU.

Okay so here's some upsetting aspects about this place, however I've visited here a few times. I loved each and every single time. During lunch hour, it's very likely you'll get a table. Even on the patio. The service is decently fast, not rushed but not financial district quick. I like that.

OK, YES, UPSETTING ASPECTS:
- tables on the patio are extremely tight/small. Big people: do not come here.
- this place closes at midnight 12 (which is so early), but we were kicked out at 11:50. Seriously!! My conversation HAS NOT ENDED yet
- the food, really, is "just ok". The calamari is not good.

Still I LOVE coming here!!

**UPDATE
the chicken pizza is actually pretty good!!
