I've been taking friends here, it has the best vibe. I love seafood pubs.

I try to sit at the bar, you get service right away. The bartenders are very friendly and approachable. Amazing people to be around.

Aside from their fantastic list of oysters, they actually have a kitchen that makes food like:
- the Tuna Ceviche, which was really good. 
- smoked fish!

The Smoker's Platter $19 had about 3-4 pieces of each of their smoked fish (ex. Haida Indian Candy, Peppered Steelhead Trout). It was sooooo delicious.

Unfortunately the beer list (ales and lagers) is just okay.

Somewhat on the pricier side, but definitely worth coming to. I came here with some friends who live in the area that I was visiting from the States -- and I'm really glad we stopped there. They're regulars here and absolutely love it.

The oysters are fantastic. And I can't even convey how much I love that they've created a wine specifically to go with them. It just makes them that much better.

And I definitely recommend trying the Manhattan clam chowder (I'm always a New England fan, but trust me on this one). It's super thick and chunky -- not just a thin tomato broth.

I recommend sitting at the bar ordering some fresh oysters and getting a bloody caesar. 

I asked about their local beers telling them I drink SoCal craft beers and they swayed me into getting their bloody caesar. After taking a sip, I knew that was a great choice. I wasn't have any luck with the beer choices available in Toronto.

Service was friendly, bread was fresh, and oysters were as fresh as they can be. 

Highly recommended for oyster lovers in Toronto!
