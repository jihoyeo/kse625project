This has got to be my favourite hangout spot ever (in the summer).

Burger and fries combo. OR burger and gelato combo.

They have great gelato here, I love the roasted almond. The burgers are just okay. Extremely messy though! 

The poutine was pretty bad.

The service is amazing!!! I think they recognize me now, which is fun. I bring friends on dates here because it's really quiet -we're usually the last group to leave. The staff does not mind that sat here forever.
