$5 Whiskey Sours on a Friday? And they're good? Word.

Last Friday I met some friends by the fire at No One Writes To The Colonel (poor Colonel, PS, at least shoot him a text) and it was a warm cozy chit chat get-drunk-before-dinner fest. 

The notoriously late-for-everything Matt M was early and he had arranged for entertainment in the form of a baby crawling on the floor towards a fire. I am always a fan of babies in bars, but here it seemed particularly bold, as she was literally crawling towards fire. Adorbs.

The cocktails are all really well crafted and the beer list is boss. I'm going to be back and try some of those snacks. They looked Yummy! The ambience is near perfect for a winter night; it's cozy without being pubby and the decor touches of mis-matched yet comfortable pieces really do it for me. 

PEPPER POINTS: For a flipping fabulous name.
