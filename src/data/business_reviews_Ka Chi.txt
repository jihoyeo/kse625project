I used to frequent this place a while ago, and recently I paid another visit. It was even better than I remembered. 

The traditional spread of complimentary Korean salads and pickles for appetizer was amazing. Each little dish was packed with flavor and well executed. The Kim Chi was deelish! 

I ordered the traditional Kam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Stew) and it was outstanding! It was flavorful, soulful and plentiful! The pork meat was piled high above the stone bowl. It was served with a side of perfectly cooked rice.

To wash down the delicious meal, a jug of very flavorful barley tea came complimentary with the meal.

It was quite a feast all for $7.95!!!
