Of all the sushi places in the city, this is the one I come back to the most.  Is it the best sushi one can find? No.  Is it the prettiest?  No.  But something about this place is pure comfort.  It's consistent, reliable, plentiful, satisfying and inexpensive. Plus, you get the primo Yorkville location without the Yorkville prices or attitude.  This place is always busy, but they will always find a way to accommodate you.
