Hopgoods really can't disappoint. The staff is a mish-mash of creative-types who know the menu like the back of their hand. 

The donair apps are consistently perfect for this East Coast gal and the beef/scallop tartar is pretty much heaven and they make some mean cocktails. 

If you drink and try everything like we do time and time again, it is pricey. Worth. It. 

The Menu is ever-changing, so I'll likely continue to update this review. 

PEPPER POINTS: For existing. I heart you.
