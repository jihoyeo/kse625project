Tonight I braved a snowstorm to try the Italian treats at Black Skirt, an unassuming Italian joint in my new hood. So this evening I learned two things: 1.) I don't have to stick to Ossington south of Dundas for culinary delights nearby. 2.) I need to buy real winter boots. I have too many pairs of shoes to not have warm feet, it's deeply absurd. 

I went with a friend and we were both starving. We both had the soup of the day, The Arancino (only one big one = O not I!) and I had the Porcini Pasta as a main. The soup was cauliflower pur√©e and really hit the spot. The Arancino option was stuffed with veal, can't go wrong there. The pasta was really creamy. I should have gone a different route, but it was exactly what they described. I just felt like something different once my food actually arrived, so I'm not going to comment too much on the pasta. If you want something rich, creamy and veg friendly, it's definitely for you. Unless you're me and are fickle and change your mind at the last second. 

I digress. 

The staff here are beyond competent and are great to chat with. A lively bunch. I'll be back soon, likely with the same date. Sorry to the table next to us who likely heard much of our inappropriate banter. But like, you guys were talking about murder, so I don't feel too bad about it. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their Oro espresso. Perfect end to a great evening if you're not drinking... or if you are!
