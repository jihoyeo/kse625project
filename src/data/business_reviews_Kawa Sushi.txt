My name is Kate. And I am addicted to Kawa Sushi. 

I remember when I first moved into my apartment my landlord mentioned Kawa. "Oh that place is good! It recently opened so it's nice to see they have business," he casually stated. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.  

Fast forward a handful of months. Kawa Sushi and I are now the best of amigos. Am I feeling lazy? Craving sushi? I can simply call and place an order and in 10 min it's ready. I have become a regular and the adorable staff laugh at my love for their salmon sushi pizza. Now and again they'll even throw in a free miso soup, because they're just that delightful. 

Care if I list a few more reason why I love it so?
- The price! $4 Salmon rolls! $7 for a giant (and I mean giant) Green Dragon roll! Yummy combos! 
- The staff! They are so so nice! It's a family business, and sometimes you'll spot they're young lil son (who is basically twins with that kid in Up) playing on his game boy. When my friend Amy and I stopped by for a snack on Halloween he even shared some of his Halloween candy with us. And he was dressed up as Buzz Lightyear. And it was so cute.   
- Did I mention the sushi pizza? Sushi pizza.

Kawa makes giving into my sushi cravings way too easy. And delicious. Go.
