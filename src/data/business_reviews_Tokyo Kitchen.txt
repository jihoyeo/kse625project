I needed a catch-up date with a long lost friend of mine. For two years, we were trying to have dinner together but it didn't happen due to conflict of schedules... UNTIL FOUR DAYS AGO!!!! I missed her dearly.

We both love sushi and there are SO MANY Japanese restaurants to choose from in this neighbourhood, which is actually really really awesome. However I chose this place because it looked like a cafe: small, quiet, peaceful, date-like. By "choosing" I really mean sending a text to my friend "Hey C, let's try here? I've never been." I've never seen it, I've never walked passed it, I don't know what's on the menu. I only saw a photo of its tables.

Tokyo Kitchen is on Charles Street, a little cafe that opens at 5:30pm for dinner (and 11:30 to 2:30 is for lunch). 

We looked through the menu, lots of the usual items like udon, fried, set dinners (they look decent for the price).... Curious about the curry dishes though! 

Anyways we ended up having the Party Tray for $29. This came with assorted sushi: spicy salmon, salmon, tuna, shrimp, soft-shell crab... So the tray came out, sushi on a plastic tray.... looked like store-bought. At first I thought it would be a plate of ordinary sushi (and I thought I wouldn't be wow'd by it), but I was wrong!!!! The sushi was presented beautifully, and it was fresh and delicious. I can be pretty picky with sushi (I've had ENOUGH store-bought sushi's and AYCE sushi's, and yes I've also eaten at expensive places that offer amazing sea urchin sushi). Tokyo Kitchen's sushi were excellent. Affordable and delicious.

The sashimi especially was amazing. I loved their tuna sushi the most -so so fresh!! 

This meal was so cheap and it was so good. I also loved that we sat by the window, it felt like a coffee shop (that serves sushi! How funky is that?). It's so cute here. 

The waitresses were very nice. We were well taken care of.
