A few things I am VERY impressed with:
- THE FOOD! and the drinks!
- the games are hand-picked!
- staff are very friendly
- LOCATION
- decor!!

I had their Cotton Candy Steamer, which is VERY very sweet (candy-like) flavored coffee. To me it's a bit odd.... but after getting used to the coffee bitter + candy sweet taste, it's actually quite nice. 

ALSO the Hanks Soda (with Vanilla Cream) is reeally really good.

OK ONWARDS: 
The food is FANTASTIC. The chicken is reeally good! Chicken was found in the Nachos ($16) and the Chicken sandwich ($8.50). The sandwiches were served with 3-4 pieces of edamame. 

P.S. soon they will be licensed to serve alcohol :) SOON.

THE GAMES? Currently they have two large shelves (4 narrow shelves) of games, but not FULLY packed like Snakes & Lattes. They're still building their collection... but many are brand new. They will continue to stock the shelves with interesting and unique games, not just ANY game they find.

YES I do love boardgames and such. 

One of the staff was very attentive and taught us how to play Ticket To Ride. (We really wanted to try this game!!)

This cafe is beautifully designed but it's VERY SMALL.  It doesn't look like they'll have enough space to accommodate the Yonge Dundas crowd! For now, since very little people know about it, it was fairly empty at 1:30pm Sunday (became full at around 4pm).

The desserts, coffee, soda, and food items are FANTASTIC! Have I mentioned this yet!???
