Service excellent. Food excellent. Atmosphere excellent. 

Bar Buca is a recent Italian American addition to this area, made possible by the King Street Food Company.  Having previously worked for Jacob's Steakhouse, I know the level of standards for KSFC are set very high. You will know what I mean when you walk into Bar Buca and are immediately greeted by Bar staff. 

We ordered Manhattans, they came accompanied by excellent complimentary aperitivo snacks. The prices are what you would expect for the quality; reasonable, in my opinion. 

There is a lot of imagination in the design of this tiny space. They maximize the area very well, and use the materials of the building to create soothingly simple, visual effects. An example of this are the walls being exposed concrete. You can also tell they spent a good amount of time on the lighting and sound acoustics. Although there are plenty of hard surfaces, the noise remains at a pleasantly soft decimal.
