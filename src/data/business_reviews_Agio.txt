Oh my goodness. 

Oh my damn.

All the reviews are so true. It's insanity. Marino runs the kitchen and the front of house all by his lonesome but does an outstanding job.

The food. My DAMN. The FOOD. Delicious. Fresh. Incredibly priced for the value of what you are getting.

We did the bruschetta. Gnocchi. Butternut squash ravioli. T-Bone.

I just can't say enough how wonderful this place was. This place is what five stars is all about. Great service. Great food. Great value.
