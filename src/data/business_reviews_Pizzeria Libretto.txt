Oh HAY Pizza Libretto! Your staff is incredibly skilled (and good looking) and your pizza is the best in the city... how on earth have I not reviewed you until now?!

This place doesn't take reservations, so if you come in on Friday at 7 expect to give your name, and then head around the corner for a drink or two. Luckily, it's Dundas and Ossington so you have plenty of options. 

I like to start with the warm olives. Simple and delicious. My favorite pizza of theirs is the Cremini Mushroom with gorgonzola AND buffalo mozzarella. Though, sometimes I like to start with the arugula salad (it's really refreshing, and mixes sweet and savory very well) followed by a good old fashioned Margherita (I ask for extra mozz... though it probably doesn't need it.)

The prices are completely reasonable for authentic Neapolitan 'za. 

I'LL BE BACK FOR: They are now serving a small cocktail list, not just the usual wine and beer, and I'm looking forward to trying one soon!

PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD: Sometimes I eat my pizza from the inside out, and leave the crust. Thus my plate looks like a crust steering wheel at the end. This annoys my favorite busser. Vroom. 

STAR SIGHTING: Once we met Russell Oliver (yes... the cash man) at PL!
