Amazing small hole in the wall place with great small plates!! Had the uni bomb and the moto eggs and a moto bun all were delicious! Also the Iggy Smalls cocktail was lovely! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Toronto. The staff is also VERY nice and accommodating- especially the host- so sweet! Sat me at a great spot at the chefs counter :)
