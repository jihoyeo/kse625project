I am truly impressed. We usually never go out for Italian food, because most places don't go beyond pizza and pasta. And why go out for food you can make from home? 

So after hearing the hype, we had to try it. Remember to make reservations! It was packed to the brim. And worth the wait. 

Our group all ordered the family meal for $28 each. At first we were afraid it wouldn't be enough food... I was so wrong! They brought everything that was currently under the Primi and Pasta section to our table. And all of it was wonderful. Lush and simple flavors. My fave was the veal lasagna. And then each person got to order a main dish. Upon my pleasant experience with the lasagna, I ordered the veal meatballs. Wow. To die for. Lovely and light seasoned veal with a heart of Parmesan cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

Maybe not a good first date place because it's hard to hear each other talk, but definitely has good mood lighting.
