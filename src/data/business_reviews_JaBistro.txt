You will come to realize that this place is as legit as it gets when there are Japanese patrons at the restaurant! 

I came here with a couple family members for dinner - we had a 5pm reservation so we were seated right away. It did start to get packed within an hour, so I recommend making a reservation.

As for the food - an amazing experience! To be honest, I love sushi rolls, but I wasn't completely comfortable with eating totally raw fish, but I gave it a try, and guess what?! I'm so glad I did!

We got:
-Lobster miso soup - Definitely one of the better miso soups I had! I got a claw in mine, which had quite a bit of meat in it!
-Lobster Platter - deceptive name because this includes a lot more than lobster. There were all kinds of seafood; lobster, shrimp, salmon, mackerel, scallops, and even wagyu beef! Note that these are ALL raw (yes, even the lobster), so be very open-minded. Keeping that in mind, pretty much everything I tried was absolutely delicious! The lobster had an interesting texture but was really good, and so was the fatty tuna (mmmm, fatty tuna)
-Carpaccio - delicious, and the sauce was great!
-Ebi nanban - basically battered tiger shrimp with tartar sauce - so much yum
-Aburicious Aburi - I've never heard of Aburi until I came here, so when I saw that they blowtorch the sushi, I wondered why this doesn't exist in NYC. The ones we tried had a unique smokey flavor, which just made it so much more bomb 

We also got some dessert sake - I really don't like the taste of sake, but the one we had was sweet, and a perfect palate cleanser. It was so good that we ended up getting another bottle!

This is definitely a more elevated experience when it comes to sushi, without any of the fancy-pancy pretentiousness. Amazing quality fish, and overall a great experience!

Protip: Parents, please leave your kids at home. It's not a kid friendly place and having to hear a toddler crying in the background does get quite aggravating!
