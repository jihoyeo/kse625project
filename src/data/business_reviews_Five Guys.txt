Mr. Rosie S. and I came to this location for a late lunch on a Friday in May - there were 4 or 5 other parties there at the time, 

The highlight of our visit was the staff for sure. Each and every one went out of their way to make our experience awesome.

1. Cashier / order-taker: Chatted with us before and after taking our order - actually interested in a conversation. Nice.

2. Cook / fry god: Threw in an extra LARGE fries-worth of fries into our bag. Yessss!

3. Cleaner / floor-sweeper:
As she came by sweeping up the peanut shells, she checked in and asked how everything was, or if we needed anything!

THE FRIES ARE SO GOOD IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. Nommmnomnomnomnom I normally don't indulge in deep fried things with such abandon but GOSH these were great!!! The large we ordered would have been more than enough for the two of us to share, and we got DOUBLE that, so we took home and re-heated in the oven later that nice! 

"Juicy burger, crispy bacon. What more can you ask for?" says Mr. Rosie S. - so he obviously loved the burger.

They do a great job of branding! It's simple, but very effective.

There is a huge vat of peanuts by the ketchup area and cute little cardboard boats that people can fill and take to their table to munch on while waiting for their meal (made to order is a nice touch).

Also I enjoy pop fountains. Call me crazy but I love mixing Orange Fanta and Gingerale. Wheeeeeee!

Like other locations, there are bags of potatoes all over the place here - in this case, they define the line-up area. Cute!
