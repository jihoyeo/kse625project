Found this dark little corner restaurant on Bloor when we were hunting for last minute oysters. Japas is open until 2am on weekdays too! The place is very dark but not in a bad way - it has a nice feel and the mood music was definitely set well. 

Initial hiccup when we walked in and there was no one to greet us. We ended up walking to the back of the restaurant before we found staff to get us seated. It was kind of empty, but with the promotions I was surprised it wasn't more full. Dollar oysters on Mondays and Tuesdays, and half off their Japanese "tapas" on Wednesdays with the purchase of a pitcher. 

We got some beers and a plate of oysters. The oysters were a little slow in coming, but we were pretty pleasantly surprised when they arrived. They were plump, medium sized malpeques in nice, salty brine. They definitely don't skimp on toppings - you get a cocktail sauce, a gingery orange sauce, and a brown salty sauce. Best part - we got real shredded horseradish instead of the preserved stuff.

I can see how the oysters were a little poorly shucked - there weren't any shell pieces or anything really gross, and each oyster sat in a delicious pool of brine. A lot of the oysters were still connected to the shell, but honestly that's OK - it doesn't take much effort to scoop your fork through before you eat it. 

Definitely will be back next week - not perfect, but love the price and the specials.
