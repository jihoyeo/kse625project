I came here twice and wow! The food is so amazing!

It is true... very pricey but a generous portion at such an elegant place. I was blown away. So I've had... (combining my two experiences)

====Appetizers (about 7-9 pieces each)====
- Tuna Tataki $10 - really soft tuna, tasted perfect. This was my favourite.
- Spicy Ebi Mayo $9 - large tasty shrimps with a hint of spiciness. It took me two bites to finish!

====Yaki Udon (portion is enough for a girl)====
- Chicken $12 - I'd say... lots of veggies, chicken was tender, and the udon was the good-quality kind! Yes, there's good and cheap quality udon...

====Classic Maki====
- Spicy Roll (8 pcs) $10 - "salmon, tuna, crunchy tempura bits, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, spicy mayo" and it's as good as it sounds. But 4/5 stars for me... good but didn't blow me away.

====Specialty Maki====
- Green Dragon (9 pcs?) $13 - Wow! This was really good! As simple as Green Dragon has always been, this was really really good!! I thoroughly enjoyed it.
- Rainbow (8 pcs) $12 - "kani, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, topped with salmon, tuna, hamachi and avocado." I loved the sashimi topping, they were so soft! They're not stingy with it either. 

SERVICE? 
Truly great. Server checked in on us frequently enough that it wasn't bothersome. We felt very taken care of and comfortable at the restaurant, and we were free to talk nonstop even after our bill! He continued to serve us water too :) 

Both times, it was about $15-20 per person. For me (a little girl), I got full! Can't speak the same for my male coworkers though.

Lastly...
I honestly came here for edamame. I LOVE EDAMAME. But both times, I wasn't with people who wanted to order that. Seeing the edamame pictures and reviews on Yelp, D'AARRGG!! I want I want I want!
