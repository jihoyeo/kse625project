After watching the performance of Memphis at Toronto Centre for the Arts (mind blowing), we came here for dinner.

It was about.. 6ish, we were the only ones there. Three people came in at about 7:30. I love the dim lighting and empty sake bottles as decor.

Darn! They don't have their menu online.... So my apologies, I don't remember at all what we got. But I remember we had soba noodles and it was soooooooooooooooo good. Sashimi pieces were thick too!

Absolutely enjoyed it here! Service was excellent. $50 dinner, for two.

I also poured tea straight onto my boyfriend's hand completely missing the cup, luckily it wasn't boiling hot.
