I can't even describe how frustrating it was to wander around a city packed with so much to do and not have access to wireless in order to use Yelp to find it! Luckily I ducked into this unassuming pizza place one early Saturday evening and ended up spending almost the entire night there thanks to its friendly bartender, delicious cocktails, and tasty food! 

A girlfriend and I posted up at the bar intending to kill just a little time with some drinks before a show down the street, and started chatting up the bartender, who was new to town as well and a chatty cathy (in a good way). He made us different cocktails and even fun shots that by the end of the night we were open to trying, and before we knew it hours had passed!

The place is good for more than just drunk fun at the bar, though. There are tables for sitting and lots on the food menu to choose from. The pizza was the best thing we tried, and the most disappointing was probably the calamari. 

Anyway, it was a totally unexpected highlight of the trip and I can't recommend this place enough for its stellar service!
