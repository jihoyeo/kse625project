Perhaps this is controversial of me, but I prefer the Danforth location to the Ossington location. 

Same great lunch prix fixe ($15 for an arugula salad and a perfectly plain pizza) plus a calmer atmosphere, and they appear to have a full bar instead of just wine, beer and a couple of cocktails. 

Same perfect pizza you've come to enjoy, only a little more grown up. The servers are also run less ragged and therefore kinder, and who doesn't love kindness? Ass holes. I guess ass holes don't love kindness, but I digress... 

PEPPER POINTS for taking reservations. Is it really so hard, people? Do you think it makes you seem thaaat much cooler? I'm darn sick of not being able to reserve my tasty treats in advance, Tarana.
