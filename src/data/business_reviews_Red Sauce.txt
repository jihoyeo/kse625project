I have liked this space in all it's incarnations, but Red Sauce is the first place I've actually loved beyond aesthetics. But let's still talk about the aesthetics! Huge Street-side patio on Cinton facing cute homes and, (unfortunately) the Dip, lovely tile interior and nice artistic touches at every turn.  

I've had their veal sandwich and their calzones, and they were both saucy, salty bundles of goodness. They have draft specials, $6 negronis on tap and $28 prosecco bottles. Basically Red Sauce is speaking my language! Thus I give them five enthusiastic cheers! 

PEPPER'S PISSED: I do have to mention, though, that their World Cup cable is about five seconds behind the Dip and it's really annoying if you're there watching a game. Also, my veg-head friend got their Buffalo Cucumbers, and it's a pretty sad little side, just cold cukes in hot sauce. Le what?
