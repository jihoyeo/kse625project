$27 for all-you-can-eat sushi...during dinner hours?! As a NYC girl, this is unheard of, so imagine my excitement when hearing about this place!

The all-you-can-menu is actually pretty extensive, and has several options. Looking at all these negative reviews, I must've come on a good night because our servers were very polite and fast with our orders. 

Obviously, you get what you pay for in terms of quality of sushi, but the ones we ordered were quite good! Besides the sashimi and sushi rolls, they have various other options, such as fried rice, dumplings - all of which I enjoyed. I was probably the most disapppointed with their sushi pizza as I've definitely had better ones before in the Toronto and NYC area.

Make sure you save room for dessert!
