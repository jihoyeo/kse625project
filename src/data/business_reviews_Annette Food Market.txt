For my 30th birthday, I was bowled over by a day of surprises. One of these shock and awe moments came from walking into Annette to find 10 of my best buddies in the back of the restaurant, drinking and eating merrily in front of a light up marquee with my name on it. 

What? Yes, you read that correctly. I have the best partners in crime in the world. 

Later, I was informed that the event was meant to be somewhere else, but the weather was so cold they needed a quick change, and somewhere that had delicious food, could handle the group and the lights... enter Annette Food Market. Their pizzas are superb, their wine list is large and in charge and their servers are lots of fun. I look forward to returning and seeing the restaurant clearly, not just through my excited tears and champagne goggles.
