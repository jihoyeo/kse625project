Ah the low rating is a bit harsh don't ya think? They do a wonderful job here, let's give them some credit, dim sum isn't easy to pull off and their restaurant isn't packed because they are bad at what they do.

Service was great, the place was packed and they did a great job from organizing the lines, flipping tables, taking orders, and bringing the food out. Great team here in my opinion.

The food was great, fresh, tasty, and all the dumplings we ordered were spot on. I was really happy at the end of my meal, dim sum takes a lot of team work and strong effort since this is a tougher service to pull off and they were doing a fine job.

I can't get this much in Iowa so this was a easy choice for me, but for the experienced pros this is a great option for you.
