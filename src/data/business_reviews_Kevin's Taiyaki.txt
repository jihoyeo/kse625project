Much better than Kevin's Kayaks (which sells boats), Kevin's Thai Yaks, which sells Yaks (poor animals), and Kevin's Type-2 Diabetes, which he probably got from eating too many of his own fish-shaped waffle-like custard desserts.

Inside an awesome Korean grocery store, near the front, to the left as you walk in, is this little stand selling amazing dessert treats. They are similar to waffles, shaped like fish, and taste of custard on the inside. They are warm and delicious. I have no idea what exactly they are or why Americans and Canadians don't really have them, but I am very lucky to have discovered them, and if you are in Toronto, so should you.

They're good enough to go out of your way for. So after you have that amazing Banh Mi from Banh Mi Boys, the best dumplings on the planet (literally) at Dumpling House on Spadina, and the amazing Pork Bone Soup from Seor across the street from there, as well as more good dumplings at Yummy Yummy... you need to get up to Bloor for dessert. You can probably knock back quite a few of these, but if you have too many of them, don't drive, or you may end up in Custardy.

One of the best hidden gems in all of Canada. Try it and then tell me I was wrong.

Actually don't, because if you do, you'll be wrong that I was wrong.

Also they don't Costner much at all.

My ex gf said she refused to eat any sort of Asian desserts so I just Federline about how this wasn't really Asian, and it worked out.

However they don't sell Bacon.

Sorry I feel a bit Spacey today.
