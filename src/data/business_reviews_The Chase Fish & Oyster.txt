Wow, this place is THE spot with great service, setting and food if you want to impress that special person. The power brokers on Bay Street seem to be in full attendance here. Dare I say I would choose this space over mainstay Bymark for that "wine and dine" meal. 

Very elegant and upscale. Mostly suits and dresses so come prepared. The entrance is down the side alley and then up an elevator from the seafood restaurant on the main floor. Tremendously seemless and on-point service with food the matches up which is rare. 

An excellent lobster truffle appetizer. The octopus app was uniquely tender and delicious. Mains included a perfectly done halibut slightly heavy on the salted crust. Scallops cooked right with a light sear and translucent through center. 

The price point is high but right now you might not find a more luxuriant dining experience in Toronto.
