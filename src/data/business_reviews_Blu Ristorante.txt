3 visits in 2 weeks with guests. Yes, you will want to be here too.

Opentable reservations prompt and courteous.
Live smooth jazz guitar and awesome vocals coming from the piano man.

I'll sum up the three visits:
Uno
Special included a (me) squid ink pasta with based octopus paperdelli and a chipono. The pasta was fantastic with a black, leather look and buttery taste. Outstanding.
Risotto of the day with sausage but not offered in 1/2. Only full orders as entries. Sad this is not an option
Her:  wrapped Veal scaloppini that rocked. 
Beat salad with buffalo materella and homemade beat pearls with a beat vinaigrette was devoured by me. Who makes their own beet pears? Blu does and they rock.

Due
Steamed mussels in white wine. Pow!
Had to try the Ossobuco. HUGE! Nice flavor and big enough to share

Tre
Crab cakes (balls) rolled off the tongue good. 
Grilled Tiger Shrimp, heck yeah.

Margaux and Tanya were excellent servers with recommendations based on our likes and dislikes. They really know the menu. I was never disappointed at Blu and will return. While on business in Toronto, I send two other parties over and all had rave reviews. 

Blu, you're doing it right. Don't go changing.
