Came here the night before Christmas with the family and my girlfriend. The food was fantastic and the service was terrific. The balsamic vinegar is sweet and pairs really well with the olive oil and the bread that are served for you. The food itself is delicious. The sauces that the chef uses are out of this world. The chef used to work at La Vecchia before quitting and starting Veloute. If you go back to La Vecchia, you will notice that the quality of food there has declined dramatically. Most of the dishes at La Vecchia are now not as flavorful because they are missing the great sauces that this chef has taken to Veloute. The steaks are delicious and marinated to perfection. 

Veloute also caters and will prepare turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas so if you don't feel like cooking a giant bird, they will do it for you as well as provide exceptional cranberry sauce and gravy.
