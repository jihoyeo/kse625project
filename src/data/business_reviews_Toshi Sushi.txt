I had these fantastic rolls recently at an event, and I have to say I was mighty impressed! Take out sushi is often a risky little game, but not with Toshi Sushi, all of their roles held up beautifully! Granted, they were all veggie, but still: rice remained sticky, rolls remained firm and seaweed kept that nice little crunch. 

Beyond the above experience, I recently popped in for a little lunch. Freshest ebi and spicy tuna I'd had in a while, and if you're in the area and you have a hankering for some fresh Japanese, this place won't disappoint. 

Ugh. Now I want sushi something desperate and it's almost midnight. Shucks.
