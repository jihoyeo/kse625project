This place is such a hidden gem - with a little emphasis on the 'hidden.' It's located on one of the side streets that connects Spadina to Kensington Market. We're talking a lot of dust, perpetual scaffolding, and some pretty aggressive panhandlers. The interior of Millie's is minimalist and clean, a pretty sharp contrast. 

The crepes here are crazzy good - forget the soggy, floppy, wan looking things you get elsewhere. These are positively crispy, almost to the point of crunch. They come rolled up like a massive ice cream cone, stuffed with delicious goodies of your choosing. 

They've got the usual, necessary toppings - strawberries, nutella, bananas, gelato. But props to them for having lychee, crushed azuki, mango, and other hard to find toppings. You can make your own crepe, or you can go for one of their premade varieties - the Japanese special is pretty awesome. A huge crepe, drizzled with nutella, rolled into a cone shape. There's a scoop of green tea ice cream surrounded by a halo of strawberries, and the bottom point of the coin is filled with crushed azuki. This is all topped with their delicious, fresh made whipped cream.

They serve savory crepes too - definitely looking forward to getting a cheese crepe.

The thing I love the most is that it's not too sickeningly sweet like other crepe places. The flavors are very mild and delicate so I don't end up feeling like swearing off sugar for a few weeks afterwards.

The owners are very nice, and are very receptive to suggestions for the menu; it seems like they're constantly experimenting with new combinations. I happened to drop by in time to sample a mille crepe cake they had been experimenting with - almost 100 crepes with custard sandwiched between, so that it resembled a cake.

100% worth a visit!
