UPDATE: they now close at 9pm on weekdays!!!

omgawd it's crazy I'm giving takeout sushi 5 stars.

This is THE place I order from when I have (forced) to work overtime. Unfortunately Sushi Shop closes at 8pm so I can't always make it there.

TIP: they take orders on the phone! They didn't ask for my credit card info so I didn't need to pay until I arrived. PLUS by the time I walk there from my office, the order is ready (lineups here can get long!) This is awesome!! 

What else is awesome? 
- soy sauce comes in a sealed container, actually wide enough to fit your sushi (even if your chop stick skills are terrible) AND plenty enough for at least two sushi rolls!! Say goodbye to soy sauce mess!! Remember back in the day: soy sauce ketchup packets that are insanely messy AND LITTLE, tiny soy sauce cups where you'd eventually lose most of it to one/two sushi.
- Red Tiger maki roll: lightly torched (TORCHED) tuna with shrimp, spicy mayo, tempura.. it's really delicious
- Spicy mayo is actually spicy
- gigantic menu with so much to choose from (blossom sushi, sushi pizza, beautiful maki rolls)

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. When I work pass 7pm, my company will pay for dinner. And I come here. It makes my overtime nights enjoyable! (before 8pm of course)

If you order about 2 fancy rolls, it can come to about $20. Not ideal for lunch...
