Another fine-dining favourite! I love this place. Like FIVE STARS love it, as you can see.

Great, cozy atmosphere - fabulous place to impress a date. AHEM! 

Officially it's called "Sotto Sotto Trattoria", so you know what kind of food you're in for.

My favourite apps are the grilled wild mushrooms and the cheese plate. The bread is (obviously) fantastic too.

My fave salad is the Carlos, though I think I've tried most of them and they're all great.

I've had a bite or two of other people's gnocchi and it's fab as well. No real idea personally about the pasta or the meat entrees, but everyone always swoons over whatever it is they have ordered, so I think every option is a safe bet here. I've also thieved bites of various desserts, which are all impressive... especially the berry flamb√©... I have a weak spot for dramatics, what can I say?

But, really, three of these stars are for three simple words:

DELLA SPIGA RISOTTI.

Oh my dog it's good. Seriously. SERIOUSLY.

I would go so far as to say it may be the best wild mushroom/truffle risotto in the city (sorry, 2nd place Mistura, it's really close).

I just wish people took me out here more often!!!

Came here last weekend w the bf
He's never tried it but was looking forward to try it from my parents great review!
We dIdnt't have res but was on yorkville and called asking if they had a table for 2 in about 15 mns if we walked down.  The guy on the phone said no problem and when we got there a table was ready right in the corner, perfect for people watching :)
My bfloved it, of course. We ordered a lot, portions are small-medium, which allows you to try different things. 
We started ordering around 9:45pm and stayed until 11:30pm the restaurant was still packed and people were even getting seated after 11pm which was great :)
Def would come back again
