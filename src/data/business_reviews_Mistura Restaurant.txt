Ohhhhh Massimo. Ohhh my lovely, tasty Massimo. Why can't you live at my house and cook me dinner EVERY night??? In my wildest dreams, he is my personal chef and brings me breakfast in bed as well. Ohhh Massimo.

OK. Down to serious business. This is definitely in my top 5 restos in TO.

My favourite meal I've eaten here? Check it - I pasted it right from the menu:

BUFALA CON PANZANELLA
Bufala Mozzarella with Heirloom Tomato, Herb Toasted Croutons, Fresh Basil, Red onion Shaved Celery & Tomato Vinaigrette

RED BEET RISOTTO
Classically Mistura

And the beet risotto. Come on. Really? I really get to eat an entire bowl of this? UnbeLEEEEVable. See, they don't include a description on the menu because it is INDESCRIBABLE. It is un-word-ly, sans paroles, somehow-gross-beets-became-heavenly good.

A note on the wine list here: I don't drink red wine. But I effing drink red wine when I'm eating here. Got me? I have 2 words for you: Chianti Classico. OMG. 

And just to make a caution point about other reviews here, I really don't believe a restaurant can or should be judged during Winterlicious/Summerlicious. 

It is the COOOOOLEST that Massimo always comes out and says hi. The COOLEST. I love him. I love his food. I love Mistura.
