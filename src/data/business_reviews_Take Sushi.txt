OKAY.. so my 5 star is because of:
- seaweed salad (now my favourite in Toronto)
- sea urchin sashimi (also my favourite in Toronto)
- soft shell crab is THE ENTIRE CRAB
- good service

Here we go!

So we had a lunch here, definitely an expensive lunch. But I must mention that this was a company lunch so my meal was paid for (tehehe).

======We started with two bowls of Kaiso Salad (the seaweed salad) $13: 
Three different kinds of seaweed served with your choice of chef's dressing or sesami dressing. 

THREE DIFF KINDS. And this is actually one huge bowl of seaweed salad! I'm going to attempt to explain this because I do love it: (1) YOU: google image search "White Seaweed" (2) Disregard the usual seaweed salad you get (the typical green one), this is totally different (3) This salad has white seaweed, red seaweed, and thicker green seaweed (4) This salad is dryer than the typical seaweed salad you get.

So hmm.. dry seaweed. White seaweed (white ones were thin)? That was new to me. Also FYI I LOVE seaweed!! So this salad -YES. IT WAS AMAZING. Fresh seaweed, tasted so different, very very crunchy/chewy? seaweed. Those two bowls were able to feed our table of 5.

I'd say... if you don't like vegetables or if seaweed is gross to you, you should probably just skip it.

======Soft Shell Crab $17:
Deep fried Soft Shell Crab served with ponzu sauce.

This was also new to me: the entire soft-shell crab.. just... laying there! Body + legs, everything! This was real cool. Definitely worth getting! RECOMMEND.

======Uni / Sea Urchin sushi or sashimi $12
We ordered the sea urchin sashimi. This came in a little bowl the size of a pudding cup, with LOTS of pieces of sea urchin. Lots (5)!! Generous? Or was the urchin REAL big? 

This was the freshest sea urchin taste EVER. You cannot really credit their kitchen if it was just luck to have a good shipment of yummy fat urchins, but this was really really delicious. I think $12 is totally worth the price for this! I finished my cup happily, and then I saw that the other cup wasn't being eaten... I took it too.

======Great sushi we had, here are their prices:
- Ikura / Salmon Roe sushi $7
- Spicy salmon roll (6 pcs) $9
- Spider roll (8 pcs) $20

============CONCLUSION============
My favourite sushi restaurant at the moment. The sushi is fresh, amazing presentation of food, good staff. Nice decor, lunch hour -not too busy. The above dishes impressed me a lot, especially the soft shell crab!! WHAT!!
