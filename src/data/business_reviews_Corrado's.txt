Every Torontonian that I mentioned this place to had never heard of it. You're missing out. Corrado's should be a staple of the city. 

The owner is charismatic and makes you feel like you're eating at his home. He defines comfort food and is actually funny. 

So I had the 

Veal Sandwich: Breaded veal with tomato sauce and green peppers. This sandwich will motivate you to learn the whole dictionary just so you can find the words with the right power to describe how good it was. The veal had zero surrounding fat, the bread was fresh, the bites would of came easy for a teenager that just got braces. 

The Famous Rice Ball: The best. The beef, the cheese, the peas..you know it's a culinary art when the ingredients rhyme. 

Whoever you may be, you have to go to Corrado's. Who knows, maybe one day Drake will instagram it and get it the attention that it deserves.
