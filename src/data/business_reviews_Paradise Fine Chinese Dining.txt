A private dinner party for my relative's great milestone 90th birthday was held at Paradise.  It was indeed paradise with a traditional Chinese style twelve course formal banquet dinner.  Quality of food is very fresh and cooked with care in Chinese Canadian fashion.  Waiter staff are courteous and friendly to welcome patrons.  Paradise comes with their own private parking lot.  Business cards are printed on clear vellum, cover stock of 48 lbs.

I highly recommend reservations for large private parties.  Paradise Fine Chinese Dining's phone number:  (416) 490-8828.
