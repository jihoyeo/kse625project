I never thought I'd give a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown 5 stars.  No, I'm not a snob, I've just eaten in way too many Chinese restaurants in my life that my expectations have been beaten down to a stump.

My husband and I were just being tourists around town when a sign that read "2 Lobsters for $25.95" caught our attention.  Well, it's 5:00PM and close enough to dinner time anyway, so why not?!  We walked in and there was only 1 other table in the whole restaurant.  Was that a bad sign?  Quickly, check the Yelp app for Sang-Ho!!  Ratings from other Yelpers seem to think this joint was pretty good.  We're satisfied.

We ordered 4 lobsters right away.  Our request is for the first 2 to be steamed with some ginger and garlic.  The other 2 to be pan fried in ginger and green onions.  We also ordered 2 squabs with our dinner.  The staff were shocked that we had ordered that much food, but we assured them with our enthusiastic smiles.  Plus, we weren't sitting right by the exit so it didn't look like we were going to dine and dash.

The owner decided to give us some free Chinese broth and that was a nice gesture.  Our main dishes came afterwards and we devoured it like it was nobody's business.  The lobster meat was succulent and sweet.  Squabs were juicy and the skin were crispy.  We didn't leave anything to waste, just like my mother always told me, "Wasting food is a crime!"  They even gave us complimentary dessert "Tong Sui", which is a dessert soup with rock sugar, red bean and sometimes taro. 

After our feast, I had to use the washroom and having been to numerous Chinese restaurants in my childhood life, I was nervous about what condition I would find it.  Surprisingly, it was clean.  I didn't have to hold my up pant legs or my breath. 

When we finally settled the bill, I noticed that they also take credit card.  Another point to you Sang-Ho Seafood Restaurant!
