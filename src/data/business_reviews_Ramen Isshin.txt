We came in on a rainy Friday night and the line had already reached the door. The waiting area was cramped. There was a bench and a few chairs along the wall, but there was also a line of people standing across the other side, leaving a narrow path for people to enter and exit. Normally, seeing a crowd like this would make me come up with a backup plan, but we had already walked a mile and a half from our Airbnb. We were committed. 

The dining area was just as small as the waiting area. There was a counter area and table and chairs setup. Service was efficient and the wait time was about fifteen minutes. 

There were four vegan choices and I went with the spicy red miso. Additionally, there were several handmade noodle choices, including two vegan options. I wanted to try the eggless kale, but they were out, so I instead got the regular vegan noodle. The ramen wasn't spicy at all, but had a really good flavor. There were brown bits in the soup and I was worried that it was meat, but it was actually tofu. I wasn't expecting a faux meat, but it was a nice touch. I knew I wasn't missing out on a good bowl of ramen just because I do not eat meat. 

The portion size was just right. I'm accustomed to restaurants that serve gigantic bowls of noodles and the guilt of letting half of it go to waste. Extremely courteous staff and excellent quality food. It was the perfect cold weather date spot.
