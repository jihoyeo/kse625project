We came here at 6pm, no lineups! But the place was near full. We were pushed into some corner really...

The waiters SHOUT a greeting when someone enters and when someone exits. It's so warm and friendly! I really do love that! All waiters/waitresses speak Japanese, including the black guy. It's a fun atmosphere.

WARNING: The food was amazing, VERY small portions, highly expensive. $4 for a small pot of tea!

Takoyaki $5 - about 4 deep fried octopus balls, really yummy though.
Hotate $8.30 - "baked Hokkaido scallop & mushrooms with garlic butter." This was so tiny but so good!
Yaki Udon $7.80 - smallest plate ever. It takes about 5 bites to finish! But this was sooooooo flavourful

No, you will not get full...

Mushroom bibimbap is my absolute favourite. Ok yes you may get full from this.

Be sure to come with friends who wouldn't mind the hefty price and the noise level. And I'm really looking forward to my next visit!
