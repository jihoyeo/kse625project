Hands down, one of the BEST dim sum places I've ever been to (and trust me, FOB that I am, I've been to many.)

People either walk out of Bright Pearl Restaurant with clogged arteries (previously clean upon entering, fyi) or ten pounds heavier, or both. And trust me, it will all be worth it -- at least for dim sum. Prices are ridiculously cheap for the quality and quantity that you get. If you come in earlier in the day, you not only beat the rush of diners, but you also get a good percentage off the total bill. Call it whatever you like, but I see it as a perk for early birds like me :P. 

The affable cart ladies and the polite chefs added to BPR's overall homey atmosphere. Paying in US dollars was a blatant giveaway that we were not Canadians which led a couple of the folks to ask where we were from. "Ohio? Where's that?" one grandfather-like employee asked us. *sigh*

Despite the wide array of dim sum dishes, certain ones can still be specially ordered; they came out in no time fresh and piping hot! The restaurant itself is huge with ample seating. In fact, it's not uncommon to see an elderly plopped in a table for eight reading the Sing Tao Daily over dim sum and tea for hours on end.

Now, if only I can convince the owner to set up a sister branch in Toledo, my life would be c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e!
